A lot of new people have been posting here recently. I wanted to share an allocation I came up with to solicit feedback but also to show you can get good exposure to growth through ETFs instead of tunneling money into stocks if you dont know how/havent had time to do due diligence on individual securities. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------


20% VOO- I chose VOO over VTI and SPY because it has the lowest expense ratio and doesnt include the smallcap holdings seen in VTI. (Low Risk Move)

15% VYM- The other etf i was considering here was NOBL, but the expense ratio is much higher at 0.35% compared to VYM's 0.06%.

10% QQQ- NASDAQ has been killing it recently, and I don't see any big players fading soon. IMO tech will continue to rise long term, even more so if any lifestyle changes caused by COVID stick. Tech

10% LQD- I wanted a 90/10 split and chose corporate bonds in part honestly due to past performance and higher yield compared t ogovt bonds. Happy to get any feedback here.

10% VEA- Some foreign market exposure. This has a low expense ratio compared to competitiors IXUS and higher liquidity than SCHF

10% VWO- Emerging markets. This helps diversify and historically has higher returns than US stocks with a bit more risk.

10% VNQ- This is a real estate play. It has a much lower expense ratio than IYR and has ligher liquidity than SCHH. This offers some good diversity and helps against inflation.

The next 3 are semi-permanent part of the portfolio that i see changing out as necessary over a period of years. My reason for these three is just that I'm a believer in the field.

5% ARKW

5% SKYY

5% IHI- I'm in this field. Beyond robotics , wearables and other sub-sectors will soon be very prevalent.","stocks",43,"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/i0kmo9/sample_etf_portfolio/"

**Summary**

The markets opened higher today, and traded mostly sideways, to show a bit of weakness towards the end of the session, but made a quick rebound 20 minutes before close to finish mostly green. The SPY was up 0.50%, the QQQ finished up 1.41%, and the DIA was even. In contrast to the unstoppable rally that the market has showcased in the last few months, we are now entering into consolidation territory.

In relation to another COVID-19 package, according to Yahoo, House Representative Nancy Pelosi has stated that the house will remain in session until lawmakers can deliver another round of relief. However, a report published today by Bloomberg that the FEDs main street lending program, which went live two months ago, and out of the $600B that was assigned, only $1.4 have been lent out under onerous terms.

APPL Apple Inc had its much anticipated #ApplEvent which had a muted impact on the stock price. Some highlights were that they unveiled new Ipads, a cheaper version of the Apple Watch, and announced a fitness service. TSLA Tesla Inc is set to have its Battery Day on September 22. In anticipation of the event Elon Musk has already tweeted that there will be many new and exciting things.

On another front, some wild news regarding EV company NKLA Nikola. There have been massive price swings, a deal announced with GM General Motors, then a report on NKLA fraud, a response from the CEO Trevor Milton, and now finally today a form-4 was published where Milton bought $1.3MM worth of shares.

In Europe, Germany is reporting good economic data. Spain is the first country to cross the 600k infection threshold. The UK is having problems with unemployment rising.

**Highlights**

***Disclaimer: There will be no market recap tomorrow since I will be travelling back to my home after the holidays.***

Stocks rose in the first trading session of the year as the three major indexes continued to hover near record-highs, building on the momentum from last week. As has been the case for weeks, market participants continue to digest surging coronavirus Omicron cases

The S&amp;P 500 (SPY), which tracks the performance of the five-hundred largest companies in the US, posted another year of amazing gains, rising roughly 27% in 2021. Within the S&amp;P 500, the energy and real estate sectors outperformed, gaining more than 42% each during the year for these sectors' best annual gains on record.

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +0.58%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): +0.96%
* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.65%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +1.29%
* Tesla (TSLA): +13.53%
* Apple (AAPL): +2.50%
* Volatility Index (VIX): -3.66%
* AMD: +4.41%
* Daimler (DMLRY): -17.51%

According to Goldman Sachs analyst David Kostin, the five largest components of the S&amp;P 500 (or Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Google) together returned 37% last year  and now constitute about 23% of the entire index.

Kostin said, In 2022, variables associated with earnings and valuation will determine the performance of the S&amp;P 500 index and its underlying constituents. Goldman Sachs now expects the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) to climb roughly 7% in 2022 to end at $510.

And indeed, this week investors will be eyeing new economic data including the Labor Department's December jobs report to help show the relative strength of U.S. economic growth in the final weeks of the year, as inflation concerns and labor shortages continued to ripple across the country. Risks around the latest surge of the coronavirus are also weighing, with impacts to the labor market from the Omicron variant potentially set to show in the final monthly jobs report for 2021.

Unfortunately, the highly contagious coronavirus Omicron variant continues to spread rapidly throughout the US and the world. The US seven-day rolling average of cases neared 400,000 on Saturday, by far the highest daily tally since the start of the pandemic and more than double the average registered on Christmas Day, according to the Financial Times data tracker.

Fortunately, the data suggests that while more contagious, the Omicron variant is less severe compared to previous strains. three separate studies coming out of South Africa, England, and Scotland indicated that people infected with Omicron are somewhere between 50-80% less likely to be hospitalized when compared to previous coronavirus strains.

**Highlights**

* After gaining more than 2% today, Apple (AAPL) became the first company in history to break the $3 trillion market cap.
* Construction spending in the U.S. rose at a 0.4% monthly clip in November, the Commerce Department said on Monday. This matched October's rate, which was in turn upwardly revised from the 0.2% monthly increase previously reported.
* The purchasing managers index for the manufacturing sector came in slightly lower than expected, reflecting continued supply-side disruptions. The PMI came in at 57.7, the lowest print in over a year.
* On Sunday, Tesla (TSLA) reported Q4 deliveries that far exceeded Wall Street estimates, which is only made more impressive when one considers how traditional automakers like Ford, Toyota, and General Motors have slashed production due to the semiconductor shortage.  Tesla delivered 308,600 vehicles in the fourth quarter, far higher than analysts' forecasts of 263,026 vehicles.
* The Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) today announced worldwide sales of semiconductors were $48.8 billion in October 2021, an increase of 24.0% from the October 2020 total of $39.4 billion and 1.1% more than the September 2021 total of $48.3 billion. Additionally, a report from Euler Hermes showed expected semi sales growth of 9% for 2022.
* A.A. Milne's 1926 book ""Winnie-the-Pooh"" was among the many classic works to lapse into the public domain in the United States. Since Milne's work is no longer protected by copyright, the text can be freely published by any company, while the characters and setting of the book can be adapted by any producer or studio.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, November 12, 2021**

Stocks advanced firmly on Friday, with market participants continuing to balance better-than-expected corporate earnings amid rising inflation. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.75% higher, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 1.05%, and the Dow Jones (DIA) broke a three day losing streak to finish 0.51% higher. 

As of Fridays close, the SPY closed the week 0.4% lower following volatility after the release of the October Consumer Price Index. However, after five consecutive weeks of gains, the market remains marginally below previous all-time highs. The QQQ closed the week 0.91% lower, while the DIA closed the week 0.97% lower.

the Labor Department released the monthly Consumer Price Index, which showed prices soared 6.2% in a year-on-year period, accelerating from Septembers 5.4% YoY rate, and higher than the 5.9% expected. This represents that fastest pace of inflationary expansion since 1990, though one has to take into account easy comparisons to last year. 

The staying power and magnitude of inflationary pressures has, perhaps, become the central question for market participants, with companies across the board reporting rising input costs and price hikes passed on to the consumers to preserve margins. While Q3 earning results have robustly demonstrated that companies in the SPY were largely able to navigate these cost pressures, the possibility remains that if inflation runs hotter than expected for longer than expected, it could begin to hamper consumer demand. 

While a rise in inflation was expected, the pace of the increase surprised to the upside. If the pace of increase is not moderated soon, it carries meaningful implications for corporations, consumers, and the Federal Reserve. As input costs rise, companies will pass the increase in cost to consumers to preserve their bottom line, who will be forced to pay the higher prices. The Fed would then be forced to step in and rise interest rates, which will makes the cost to borrow money more expensive, which means people and companies will likely spend less, leading to a fall in demand for goods and services. A rise in interest rates would particularly hurt high P/E tech stocks that have been flying in the last two years, as these companies rely on borrowing to fund their aggressive expansion.

Still, the Federal Reserve and many economists have reaffirmed that the inflationary pressures are transitory, caused by pandemic-era disruptions in global trade and will eventually ease, albeit while likely settling at a higher level than had been present before the pandemic. 

Gabriela Santos, Global Market Strategist at JP Morgan, said Inflation should moderate. Were talking about settling at 2%, 2.5% over the course of the next 12 months. So we're still talking about real wage gains, and that's extremely supportive, certainly of people's livelihoods, but also of consumption and hence the economy overall. We do expect a big re-acceleration in growth starting this quarter and throughout next year, \[and\] 5% average growth just over the next three quarters. So we would characterize this not as stagflation, but as reflation. And that difference is, reflation is actually quite good for earnings growth and quite good for the stock market, especially cyclical sectors."" So far, expectations are that the Fed will step in sometime mid-2022 to raise interest rates.

**Highlights**

* Shares of Rivian (RIVN), which is backed by Ford and Amazon,  continue to be on absolute fire. The company, which is expected to lose $1.28 billion on no more than $1 million in revenue this quarter, now has a market cap of more than $100 billion. For perspective, they are now the fourth largest automaker in the world by market cap. Im not a stickler for valuation, but this is absolute insanity and unsustainable. The company has not started production and is already priced to perfection, which they are bound to hit a snag with. I dont think this price is sustainable. 
* The University of Michigans closely monitored Consumer Sentiment survey showed the consumer sentiment index decreased to 66.8 from 71.7 in October, missing estimates of 72.5. Waning confidence reflects  an escalating inflation rate and the growing belief among consumers that no effective policies have yet been developed to reduce the damage from surging inflation, Richard Curtin, director of the survey, said in a statement.
* A Snap (SNAP) investor sued the social media company alleging it downplayed how Apples (AAPL) change in privacy would affect revenue. Remember, the stock plummeted 25% after an earnings miss, citing Apples changes as hampering ad revenue. 
* After more than a decade of explosive growth, China's Singles' Day, the world's biggest online shopping fest, is losing its gloss and bracing for more modest growth in coming years, hurt by a slower economy and tighter regulatory scrutiny. Alibaba (BABA) said on Friday its sales - or gross merchandise value (GMV) - during the 11 day event grew 8.5%, the slowest rate ever and the first time it came under double-digits growth. 
* The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday said it rejected an exchange-traded fund from VanEck that would have tracked Bitc& spot prices directly. This would have stood in contrast to the ProShares ETF (BITO), which was approved and which only tracks futures rather than prices directly.

Stocks traded higher throughout the day before pulling back steeply in the last hour of trading in another extremely volatile day. While major benchmarks are up around 4% in the last five trading days, intraday volatility has been extreme, making options trading difficult. Traders weighed a wild presidential debate and developments among Congressional lawmakers for further fiscal stimulus. Stocks recovered in the last 20 minutes of the market, capping off an extremely volatile final hour.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.68% up, the S&amp;P (SPY) finished the day 0.59% up, and the Dow (DIA) led the day finishing 0.99% up. 

Yesterdays presidential debate between Pres. Trump and Joe Biden proved to be an extremely contentious affairs, with Trump frequently interrupting both Biden the moderator, Chris Wallace who could not control the candidates, and a slew of highly personal attacks from both sides. The Guardian branded the debate a national humiliation. With the election in 36 days, analysts expect volatility to increase as November 3rd gets closer. Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said I think markets are really nervous into those 36 days \[before the election\] and one of the things we have to think about is, when does nervousness price in the worst is yet to come? When do you think the worst is priced in? Theres $4.3 trillion in cash on the sidelines. I dont think in the history of any financial market in the world do you ever have a top when theres 20% of the equity market sitting in cash. Investor cash  thats excluding the private equity cash, the record cash held by corporates too. So youve got tons of dry powder. People are bearish.

The election comes against a dire economic situation, especially in the labor, with major corporations recently announcing new rounds of job cuts. Disney (DIS) announced it was slashing 28,000 jobs in their theme parks, cruise line, and retailers. Shell (RDS) announced it was cutting 9,000 jobs as the pandemic has affected the demand for oil. According to CNN business, tens of thousands of airline jobs could be lost as soon as tomorrow, as a federal prohibition on job cuts in the industry expires. Airline executives say they are prepared to keep workers only if Congress approves $25 billion in grants. 

Congressional lawmakers and the Trump administration are attempting to come to a deal in the near-term to provide additional fiscal relief to the families and small businesses that are struggling in the pandemic. House Democrats are pushing forward with a new $2.2 trillion proposal as speaker Pelosi and the White House make a final attempt to strike a deal before the election. Today, Pelosi and Mnuchin were unable to strike a deal after a 90-minute meeting. The pair said they will continue discussion as they continue to work to craft legislation that could pass both Houses of Congress. House Democrats are holding a vote on their plan today, a largely symbolic gesture as McConnel has already opposed the plan. Republicans are rumored to have a $1-1.5 trillion ceiling for any new relief legislation.

The stock market opened the day but reversed course and bounced today as investors digested the Federal Reserves final monetary policy decision of 2021 and Fed Chair Jerome Powells speech against a backdrop of persistent inflationary pressures. Bond yields rose up in the immediate aftermath of the Feds announcement, rising above 1.46%.

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +1.56%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): +2.28%
* Dow Jones (DIA): 1.02%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +1.59%

Today, the Fed announced it would double the pace of tapering and signaled a strong likelihood that there would be an interest hike, probably around August-September (according to the Feds dot-plot), the first since rates were slashed to near zero in March 2020. This was largely the expected outcome of this meeting. 

Since the depths of the pandemic, the Fed has added trillions of dollars in U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage-backed securities to boost liquidity during a time of crisis and prevent a credit crunch. In November, the Fed started to taper the pace of those aggregate purchases by $15 billion per month, and will now double that pace to $30 billion per month.

A statement by the Fed said, In light of inflation developments and the further improvement in the labor market, the Committee decided to reduce the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $20 billion for Treasury securities and $10 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities.

The new pacing would bring all asset purchases to a full stop by March 2022, faster than the course set forth in November that originally sought to end purchases by the middle of next year. The decision had unanimous agreement.

A quicker taper gives the Fed room to move earlier on interest rate hikes. All of the 18 members present at the meeting said they could see the case for at least one rate hike next year, a noticeable revision up from [September projections showing a 50-50 split on a 2022 rate hike](https://news.yahoo.com/fed-fomc-monetary-policy-decision-september-2021-141145429.html).

The updated dot plots, which map out each of the FOMC members projections for where rates will be in coming years, shows the median member of the committee projecting three rate hikes next year, another three in 2023, and another two in 2024. Link for dot-plot below

[https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20211215.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20211215.pdf)

The Fed said, Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to elevated levels of inflation.

The median expectation of the committee sees core personal consumption expenditures, the Feds preferred measure of inflation, 

clocking in at 2.6% in 2022 (compared to 2.2% in the Feds September projections). Core PCE came in at 4.1% in October (data for November core PCE comes out December 23.

The next Fed meeting is scheduled to take place Jan. 25 and 26.

Art Hogan, Chief Market Strategist at the National Securities Corporation said, When you have an anticipation of higher interest rates, growth stocks or long-duration growth stocks certainly get hit the hardest. When you do that net present value calculation with a higher interest rate, that implied multiple or ascribed multiple to growth names comes in. So a lot of that's been priced in. When you think about some of those real growth-y names and momentum names and risk assets, they've seen a lot of carnage already.""

He continued, What the market is trying to tell us here is that when you set your asset allocation plan for next year, you want to have a barbell approach with growth on one side  you want to have those growth names that are actually valued at a multiple to earnings, not a multiple to revenues or a multiple to cash flows or a multiple to sales. We anticipate 2022 is going to be very much like 2021, where you really want to have a balance between growth and value.""

I broadly agree with this perspective, 2021 was a hard year for a lot of people who went too heavy into growth after an insane 2020. Its always important to have a good mix between growth, value, and Ill add safe ETFs.

* Shares of Pfizer (PFE) jumped to a fresh record intraday high on Wednesday amid optimism over the company's COVID-19 pill, called Paxlovid. President Joe Biden said Tuesday that the White House had ordered enough of the antiviral pills to treat 10 million Americans, and that he was ""encouraged by the promising data"" that the drug-maker released on the pill. Pfizer's data showed earlier this week that the drug decreased the risk of hospitalization or death by 89% for high-risk adults. 
* Amazon's web hosting platform Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced connectivity issues Wednesday morning, triggering outages at platforms from Zoom Video Communications to Amazon-owned Twitch and other online services. 
* Retail sales were up 0.3% in November compared to October, [the Commerce Department said on Wednesday](https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf). This came in below the 0.8% monthly increase consensus economists were expecting, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. In October, retail sales rose 1.8%, which was upwardly revised from the 1.7% increase previously expected. 
* The office of the U.S. Trade Representative is concerned with Canada's announcement that it will continue to pursue a unilateral digital services tax, a USTR spokesperson said in a statement on Wednesday. If Canada adopts a DST, USTR would examine all options, including under our trade agreements and domestic statutes, it said.
* Food safety issues were found at over a dozen Starbucks outlets in the eastern Chinese city of Suzhou, regulators said on Tuesday, a day after the U.S. coffee chain was criticized for violations at two other outlets in another city.

The good times keep on rolling! The remarkable rally in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) continued, which each index recording fresh intraday highs the day after the Federal Reserves decision to being tapering the pace of quantitative easing as the US economy reaches the substantial progress benchmark outlined by the Fed back in December 2020.

As was widely expected and extensively talked about on these recaps, the Fed announced it would begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing this month. As a reminder QE is one of the most powerful tools the fed has to help underpin the economy and financial markets during times of stress or crises (like the pandemic). Since last year, the Fed had been running QE at a clip of $120 billion per month. That pace will now begin to slow. 

The Fed said in a statement, In light of the substantial further progress the economy has made toward the Committees goals since last December, the Committee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. 

Specifically, the Fed said it would begin reducing its asset purchases this month by a total of $15 billion, and then by another $15 billion in December, but said the outlook for the pace of tapering in the future would depend on ""changes in the economic outlook."" Fed Chair Jerome Powell also reiterated his prior stance that the ultimate end of the tapering process next year would not automatically signal the start to interest rate hikes. 

New weekly jobless claims came at a fresh pandemic-era low, with further improvements in the labor market coming as companies continue to compete to attract and retain workers amid elevated demand. New jobless claims came in at the lowest level since March 2020 at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Here are the numbers:

* **Initial unemployment claims, week ended October 30:** 269,000 vs. 275,000 expected and a revised 283,000 during prior week
* **Continuing claims, week ended October 23:** 2.105. million vs. 2.147 million expected and a revised 2.239 million during prior week

SPY gained 8% and QQQ gained 13% in less than 2 weeks which seems surprising with the current environment when we have inflation out of control, high commodities prices and one of the worst fed tightening in decades.

I am not trying to time the market and I keep adding in undervalued stocks but I do not want to get dragged into ""FOMO"" rally. I am long-term bullish and I only have one cheap put contract as a small hedge. There is huge SPY puts flow but this could be MMs hedging their portfolios.

My take (not a financial advisor):

Bottom line: Nobody knows anything.

I think Fed is way behind the curve and they eventually will have to aggressive and do more rate hikes and slow economy. However, I think recession is less likely due to strong labor market. We might revisit close to Feb-Mar lows but it might not happen until Apr-May when companies start to report Q2 earnings and next FOMC meeting. QQQ might reach to \~365 and SPY to \~455 before another correction happens.

"10","2021-02-17",1613602745,"Technical Analysis Series (4): Relative Strength Index (RSI)","Hey Trader Gang!

Today I bring to you an introduction to one of my favorite indicators, the Relative Strength Index (RSI). In my opinion, RSI is perhaps one of the most widely misunderstood and incorrectly applied indicators across the broader trading space. Whenever you see RSI getting talked about on CNBC, they usually say something along the lines of, ""RSI is severely overbought, so the stock must go down soon."" If that's all you know about RSI, or you don't even know wtf RSI is to begin with, this post is for you!

As I will explain in this post, technical analysis on RSI is much more nuanced than if the RSI is merely over 70 (standard overbought range) or under 30 (standard oversold range). RSI becomes truly powerful when it used in tandem with analysis of the price action of the asset to spot ***DIVERGENCE*** between the RSI and the price of the asset. In this post we will run through what RSI is, what divergence is and how to spot it, the various ranges on RSI, and a few other tips and tricks I've learned over the years.

So let's get into it.

**What is RSI?**

RSI stands for Relative Strength Index and is a ***momentum*** indicator that measures the magnitude of recent price movements to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions. RSI was developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr., and was introduced by him in 1978.

A critical concept for new technical analysts to understand is the difference between price action trends and momentum trends. Price ***can*** ***keep going up*** as momentum drops off in strong trending markets, which results in ***divergence*** building between the price action and the momentum oscillator. Furthermore, in strong trending markets this divergence can build for a significant amount of time. So, just because momentum is dropping off does not necessarily imply that price action will immediately fall off a cliff.

**The Number Crunching for the Curious**

While not necessary for this post, a general explanation of how RSI is calculated is useful in understanding the indicator.

RSI is derived through a two step calculation:

Step 1:

*RSI* step one = 100  \[100 / 1 + average gain/average loss\]

The average gain or loss utilized for this calculation is the average percentage gain or loss during the selected ***look-back period*** (I will touch on the relevance of this look back period more when we get to covering divergences on RSI). For the math guys and gals out there it should also be noted that the formula uses a positive value for the average loss.

The standard setting for the RSI ***look-back period*** is 14. Accordingly, on a 1 Day time frame chart, the RSI is looking at the prior 14 days of price action to determine the average gain/average loss values. I will speak more about the ***look-back period*** later and its relevance to spotting divergences in price action.

Step 2:

Once the data for the 14 periods is derived, step two of the calculation may take place:

*RSI* step two = 100 \[100/ 1 + ((Previous Average Gain × 13) + Current Gain/ (Previous Average Loss × 13) + Current Loss)\]

Using the two-step formula approach above results in the current RSI number, lying somewhere between 100 and 0. Using this formula, RSI will only near 100 or 0 in **extremely strong trending markets**. This is because an integral component of the RSI formula is comparing the current gain to the previous average gains and losses, so for RSI to get close to 100 or 0 the asset really needs to be moving like a breakaway train.

**RSI LOOK-BACK PERIOD AND EMA**

As previously mentioned, the standard RSI look-back period is 14. This means that the RSI calculation is taking into account the prior 14 periods, and therefore divergences on price action outside of this 14 period look-back loose a significant amount of relevance. Personally, I set my look-back period for RSI at 21 because it allows for a larger data set to be analyzed when looking for divergences.

In addition, I run an ema on my RSI as I find it useful for analysis of the indicator (14 period RSI/22 or 21 ema and 21 period RSI/9 ema).

**What is Divergence**

To really get into discussing RSI we also need to cover Divergence. This is a quick crash course on various types of divergence, although I could dedicate an entire post to merely this topic alone. Divergence occurs when momentum oscillators are not lining up with the price action, thereby indicating a potential incoming change in the price of the asset. Spotting divergences can take quite a bit of practice, so don't get discouraged if it doesn't immediately click. Nobody said this stuff was easy!

Below is a little cheat sheet on divergences in relation to price action (the blue lines represent price action and the red lines represent a momentum oscillator such as RSI): [https://imgur.com/gallery/EfcNF28](https://imgur.com/gallery/EfcNF28)

The simplified rationale for what these divergences mean is as follows:

**Regular Bearish Divergence**: price is setting a higher high while the oscillator is setting a lower high.

* This divergence signifies that there is less momentum accompanying the higher high in price, therefore signaling that participation by the bulls is dwindling at these higher price levels.
* Here is an example of regular bearish divergence playing out on Nike on the 3 day chart: [https://imgur.com/user/DrPipsRipsDips/posts](https://imgur.com/user/DrPipsRipsDips/posts)

**Regular Bullish Divergence:** price is setting a lower low while the oscillator is setting a higher low.

* This divergence signifies that there is less momentum accompanying the lower low in price, therefore signaling that participation by the bears is dwindling at these lower price levels.
* Here is an example of regular bullish divergence playing out on Nike on the 3 day chart: [https://imgur.com/gallery/FtCFWIr](https://imgur.com/gallery/FtCFWIr)

**Hidden Bearish Divergence**: price is setting a lower low ***in a downtrend***while the oscillators is setting a higher high.

* This divergence signifies that there is more momentum/buy pressure being put into the asset and despite that there is a resulting lower low in price.
   * In essence this shows that the bulls are pumping in increased momentum into the asset and that still cannot prevent a lower low from taking place.
   * Hidden divergences can be quite tricky to spot for the new trader and my general rule of thumb is play hidden bear div in bear markets, not bull markets.
* Here is an example of hidden bearish divergence playing out on Nike on the 3 Day chart: [https://imgur.com/gallery/OYTz3x0](https://imgur.com/gallery/OYTz3x0)

**Hidden Bullish Divergence**: price is setting a higher low ***in an uptrend*** while the oscillator is setting a lower low.

* This divergence signifies that there is less momentum/buy pressure being put into the asset and despite that drop in buy pressure there is a higher low in price.
   * In essence this shows that the bears are selling more and the bulls are buying less and yet this still cannot prevent a higher low (bears would want a lower low) from taking place.
   * Hidden divergence can be quite tricky to spot for the new trader and my general rule of thumb is play hidden bull div in bull markets, not bear markets.
* Here is an example of hidden bullish divergence playing out on Nike on the 3 Day chart: [https://imgur.com/gallery/dFaCxuw](https://imgur.com/gallery/dFaCxuw)

**Elevated Divergence:**

* Elevated Divergence is driving at the same concepts explained in Regular Bull/Bear divergence, except instead of a higher or lower price, the oscillator is much higher or lower while price **is the same**. This also indicates a significant shift of momentum on the asset in relation to price.

A ***critical element*** of the RSI formula to keep in mind is that the RSI values are calculated off of the ***closing price*** of the candle. Accordingly, candle wicks ***should not*** be used to try and spot divergence. For spotting divergences on RSI the correct methodology should be that on green candles the top of the candle body is used and on red candles the bottom of the candle body is used.

Another ***critical element*** on divergence is that divergence will often ""build"", especially if using a lower term time frame such as the 1 day, 4 hour, 1 hour, etc. On lower and medium term time frames it is often prudent to wait and see three ""strikes"" of divergence before looking to make a trade based upon the RSI divergence.

See the multiple strikes of divergence present on the 4h for QQQ: [https://imgur.com/gallery/BdgEhpB](https://imgur.com/gallery/BdgEhpB)

**Major RSI Zones &amp; Overbought/Oversold Levels**

The zone that the RSI currently finds itself within can give a strong indication of whether bulls or bears are in control. It should be noted that these zones gain more relevance on higher time frames regarding who is in control of the larger trend. In addition, how price action reacts off of the borders of these zones can be very useful for technical analysis. For example, if price is trying to break over a critical horizontal resistance level, but RSI is rejected from getting into the bull control zone (over 65), it may very well be an early indication that the breakout is going to fail, or at least stall for a bit.

**ZONES**

The Zones are as follows:

1. 65+ = bull control zone (bulls are regarded as being in control with RSI above this level)
2. 64-46 = neutral zone (this area is regarded as neutral, and may be dipped into on a bullish/bearish ""reset' of the oscillators)
3. 45- = bear control zone (bears are regarded as being in control with RSI below this level)

Below are some examples of RSI zones in action:

1. Rejection of getting into bull control zone: [https://imgur.com/gallery/f46SCR5](https://imgur.com/gallery/f46SCR5)
2. Finding support along edge of bear control zone: [https://imgur.com/gallery/YF4eIYD](https://imgur.com/gallery/YF4eIYD)

**OVERBOUGHT/OVERSOLD**

Due to the reasons explained in this post, blindly selling or buying an asset merely because it is overbought or oversold will often result in less than ideal results. However, whether an asset is ""overbought/oversold"" is still an important factor to consider and ***I have noticed*** that on very high time frames (1 week, 1 month) an asset will not remain overbought or oversold for a very long period of time. That being said, in strong bull markets RSI can spend more time over 80 than you'd think and the same applies for strong bear markets and under 30/20. Conversely, in a strong bull market RSI on higher term time frames will often bounce extremely quickly from under 30 reflecting the strong macro trend (vice versa for over 70 in bear markets).

Below are the criteria for overbought and oversold:

1. Overbought = over 70 (over 80 in strong bull markets)
   1. Here is a chart of overbought RSI on the 1 week on S&amp;P 500 futures: [https://imgur.com/gallery/BDE4iWF](https://imgur.com/gallery/BDE4iWF)
2. Oversold = below 30 (below 20 in strong bear markets, if anyone still remembers what one of those is :D)
   1. Here is a chart of oversold RSI on the 1 week on S&amp;P 500 Futures: [https://imgur.com/gallery/2h7RIW4](https://imgur.com/gallery/2h7RIW4)

That covers this crash course in RSI. Now the next time you hear a suit on TV or a Youtuber talking about overbought/oversold RSI and that as a result the asset must reverse course soon, you can proudly assure yourself that the person doesn't know as much as about RSI as you do!","stocks",10,"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lm76sy/technical_analysis_series_4_relative_strength/"

Stocks were mostly higher Thursday, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) leading the way, as market participants await the beginning of first-quarter earnings season and digest comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

After a choppy first quarter to the year, the Dow Jones (DIA) and S&amp;P 500 (SPY) largely recovered in the first week of Q2 and continue to hover near record highs. The equity market got a boost after FOMC members signaled in their March meeting that the Fed continues to favor maintaining highly accommodative monetary policies for the foreseeable future and signaling they will hold off on tightening policy at the first sights of inflation. Jeffrey  Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab said, A big part of this is making sure the vaccine-led recovery is firmly rooted, and that won't be clear until somewhere in the second half of this year. So it's possible that as we look out to the late summer timeframe or early fall that that's something that we could consider at that point. But until then, there's still a lot of risks. and just to backtrack it, we know that monetary policy works with a lag, and so it makes more sense to ensure that we're on solid footing before you begin to take your foot off the pedal."" 

Furthermore, Speaking at a virtual meeting at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell highlighted the uneven recovery in the US labor market as a sign the economic recovery still has a ways to go in order to meet the Federal Reserves employment goals. He said The recovery though here remains uneven and incomplete. Tee burden is still falling on lower-income workers. The unemployment rate in the bottom quartile is still 20%. There are still eight and a half million people out of work. This unevenness that were talking about is a very serious issue. 

Looking ahead, market participants will be closely monitoring the upcoming earnings season for the first three months (Q1) of 2021. Over the past several weeks, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by record levels with the expectation that recent economic growth will drive corporate earnings higher. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far. Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer at Charles Schwab said, Were still in probably the early parts of the expansionary cyclical after recovering from that recession. Weve started to see cyclical trades playing a big role in the early part of the cycle. Normally what happens at this stage is you continue to see & the cyclical component will continue to drive leadership into the second part of this year into next year.

Stocks closed the first week of 2022 in the red, the worst start to a year since 2016, as market participants continue to digest the December labor market and the Federal Reserves meeting minutes, which signaled participants favor an interest rate hike relatively soon. The Nasdaq (QQQ) suffered its worst week since February 2021.

The Labor Departments December jobs report released this morning showed the US added a disappointing 199,000 in December, coming in way below expectations and an unexpected slowdown compared to the previous month. 

Other metrics, however, were more upbeat, as the unemployment rate improved to a fresh pandemic-era low of 3.9%, and the labor force participation rate steadied after an upward revision in November. Still, many economists cautioned that a more recent hit to the labor market from the surge in Omicron cases may not yet have been. captured in the December report. 

By industry, some of the services-related sectors hardest-hit initially by the pandemic saw muted hiring at the end of December. Leisure and hospitality jobs rose by 53,000 in the last month of the year, rising compared to November's gain of 41,000, but coming in well below the 211,000 seen in October. 

Other industries saw a deceleration in hiring in December. Transportation and warehousing jobs rose by just under 19,000 during the month after a rise of more than 42,000 in November, while professional and business services positions rose by 43,000 after a gain of 72,000 during the prior month. Education and health services employment gains totaled 10,000, slowing from 14,000 in the prior period. Meanwhile, retail trade employers shed jobs for a back-to-back month. 

Here are the numbers:

* **Non-farm payrolls:** \+199,000 vs. +450,000 expected and a revised +249,000 in November
* **Unemployment rate:** 3.9% vs. 4.1% expected and 4.2% in November 
* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.6% vs. 0.4% expected and a revised 0.4% in November
* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 4.7% vs. 4.2% expected and a revised 5.1% in November

Marty Walsh, US Secretary of Labor, said It's a solid report. Obviously, it didn't hit what the experts had said ... but when you look at 2021 as a combined total, as the president has been sworn into office, passed the American Rescue Plan, 6.4 million jobs have been added, which is a record. There's no question that we still have people out of work, we have people that have left the workforce. We're working on also inflation,"" he added. ""So we do have some work to move forward.""

Coming into the December job report, stocks were already under pressure as market participants digested recent comments from the Federal Reserve, suggesting an interest rate hike could come soon. With policymakers closely watching for signs that the economy has reached maximum employment, the jobs report could provide additional fodder for the Fed to double down on its more hawkish tilt. 

In the latest meeting minutes, participants suggested they were inclined to further speed up the pace of tapering and accelerate the timeline to raise interest rates.

Mohamed El-Erian, President of Queens College at Cambridge University and Allianz Chief Economic Advisor said, The way I view it is very simple: The Fed delivered a wonderful year for markets in 2021, at the cost of a much more complicated outlook in 2022. And that complicated outlook is for policy, is for the economy, and therefore is a more uncertain outlook for markets. This is still a very robust economy. If we avoid a policy mistake  big if. But if we avoid a policy mistake, this economy has all the ingredients to continue growing and grow in a more inclusive manner. But we do need help on labor force participation and productivity. We do need help on the supply side.

* Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG) both suffered their worst single-week decline since the beginning of the pandemic, with shares falling -5.4% and -6.6% respectively.
* Mortgage rates rose to their highest level in more than a year and a half after details from the Federal Reserve's last policy-setting meeting released on Wednesday hardened expectations for a higher interest-rate environment.
* The rate on the 30-year fixed mortgage jumped from 3.11% to 3.22% this week, according to Freddie Mac. 
* The Commerce Department reported Thursday morning that U.S. factory orders accelerated in November, climbing 1.6% during the month.

Theres no sugarcoating it, Cathy Woods Ark Funds got clobbered, her strategy does work in the current environment. Im not arguing that shes the best fund manager of all time. No risk management

Im just looking at the stocks in ARKK such as Zoom, Tesla, Block, Shopify, Teladoc, Roku, etc. and asking myself do we really think these stocks wont be around 5 years from now? 

These stocks are all down like 80% or more from ATHs and a lot of these stocks are trading well below pre-pandemic levels 

The bottom for the  S&amp;P 500 and QQQ was around September 2002 during the dot.com bubble, and March 2009 for the financial crisis. 

Apple, which was more speculative back then before it was the tech giant today, bottomed in 12/2000 and 12/2008.

 Netflix bottomed in 7/2007. 

Google bottomed in 11/2008. 

Amazon bottomed in 9/2001 and 11/2008. 

The point is that high-growth, more speculative tech companies hit their bottom months or up to a year before the broad index funds. 

To outperform the market you need to be doing something radically different

Everyone gave up on Cathys stocks a while ago and the the sentiment towards her and her strategies are sooo negative right now. It may soon be time to buy the fear. To follow the herd is to buy high and sell low after that 2020 stimulus bubble in equities 


Cathy may be a fool in this market cycle, but how the f$ck are you people not buying at least a few shares of these ARK funds? Its much closer to a bottom than the broad index funds","stocks",132,"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1010h62/where_is_everyones_contrarian_spirit/"

I have heard people say that the Nasdaq and technology in general is in a bubble. While you can certainly make a case that it is overvalued, there are some key differences to the tech/dotcom dubble of 2000 that would make it unfair to say that we are that those levels. 

There are definitely tech stocks that show similarities to the stocks that were responsible for 2000 tech crash, such as little to no earnings, pe ratios at 100, 500, or even 1000. But the tech sector and QQQ, which is overweight in tech, is not showing these bubble like characteristics as a whole. Most of these companies are large or mega cap companies with years of solid growth and profitability. Yes, they could very well be overvalued, but investing in overvalued companies or sectors is still reasonable if you buy and hold into them with a long time horizon, while dollar cost averaging. 

The current PE ratio of QQQ is somewhere in the mid 30s. The historical PE ratio of QQQ in March 2000 was 190.","stocks",41,"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/o78rof/using_historical_pe_ratio_data_qqq_is_nowhere/"
"18","2021-11-15",1637015975,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, Nov 15, 2021. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 15, 2021**

Stocks finished mixed, with the Dow Jones (DIA) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closing modestly lower, as market participants digested upbeat economic data coming from China and await for a key report on retail sales in the US later this week. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, underperformed on the day, closing 0.44% lower.

Stronger than expected economic data coming out of China helped lift the sentiments of market participants following last weeks inflation report. The world's second-largest economy saw both retail sales and industrial production unexpectedly rise in October in a year-over-year period, suggesting that Chinas economy is holding up better than expected amid new stay-in-place restrictions and ongoing power shortages. However, prices of new homes dropped 0.25% in October versus September, marking the biggest drop in more than six years as the nations real estate market remains under pressure from the Evergrande situation. Here are the numbers:

* Retail Sales: +4.9% YoY vs +3.5 expected
* Industrial Production: +3.5% YoY vs +3% expected

Tomorrow, market participants will receive the Commerce Departments monthly Retail Sales report, which is expected to show a 1.3% year-over-year rise in retail sales, improving from Septembers disappointing 0.7% rise. Moreover, major retailers like Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD), and Lowes (LOW) are set to report Q3 earnings, which will offer additional data regarding the state of consumer demand.

Last week, markets were spooked by the pace of inflation, with the recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) showing the fastest pace of increase in roughly 30 years. which showed prices soared 6.2% in a year-on-year period, accelerating from Septembers 5.4% YoY rate, and higher than the 5.9% expected. The staying power and magnitude of inflationary pressures has, perhaps, become the central question for market participants, with companies across the board reporting rising input costs and price hikes passed on to the consumers to preserve margins. While Q3 earning results have robustly demonstrated that companies in the SPY were largely able to navigate these cost pressures, the possibility remains that if inflation runs hotter than expected for longer than expected, it could begin to hamper consumer demand.

Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note to clients, The surge in core inflation in October marks the start of a run of big gains, thanks to surging used auto prices, rebounding airline fares, and faster increases in housing costs. We think core inflation will peak at almost 7% in March, which will pose a serious challenge to the Fed's benign medium-term view. Chair \[Jerome\] Powell will have to convince markets that the combination of rocketing payrolls and soaring inflation does not threaten the transitory story, to which he appears still to be committed. We remain of the view that the Fed will start to hike in September, but a June hike can't be ruled out. If labor participation shows no sign of life by the March FOMC meeting, we expect the Fed to accelerate the taper and then hike in June. This would play badly across all asset markets. As always, it is important to acknowledge and understand the risks present in the market.

**Highlights**

* Shares of Boeing (BA) surged after the company said it was hopeful China would resume order of the 737 Max two years after its grounding.
* U.S. crude oil output from the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico is set to jump to a record 4.95 million barrels per day in December, a new government forecast showed on Monday. This would bring production in the key U.S. shale patch well above its pre-pandemic average from March 2020.
* Shares of oat-milk maker Oatly (OTLY) fell more than 20% after missing earnings expectations and cutting guidance. The stock is down roughly 50% since IPO back in late-May.
* Shares of Snap (SNAP) were up after the company reached a deal with Sony Music Entertainment to allow the company to use its artist and sounds on the Snapchat App.
* Twitter Inc said on Monday it will expand free access to the social networking site's data to help software developers create tools and products that could promote safer online conversations or curate content. The move is part of Twitter's growing effort over the past year to decentralize the company, a vision that aims to give users more control over what content they see in their Twitter feed or have new ways of sharing content on the site, Amir Shevat, Twitter's head of product for the developer platform, said in an interview.
* Amazon.com Inc has reached a deal to sell virtual medical services to Hilton Hotels in the United States, one of the first major customers for the companys burgeoning healthcare business. Amazon Care is an on-demand health offering that lets users message or video-chat clinicians and receive home visits in some cities.
* UK ministers are expected to order an in-depth investigation of Nvidia Corp's planned $40 billion acquisition of British chip designer ARM over antitrust and national security concerns. As a huge NVDA bull, hope all goes well!
* Social Finance Tech (SOFI) announced an offering of 50 million shares. The stock is down as a result. Not surprising for management to take advantage of this massive runup
* Shares of oat-meal maker Oatly (OTLY) gapped down -20% after missing earnings expectations and cutting guidance moving forward. After a promising start, the stock is now roughly -50% since its IPO

Cheers to the bull on recent market rally.

I have been on sidelines since Dec-Jan and I have enough cash ready to deploy. I am not trying to time the bottom but waiting for better economic environment. I did not buy in June thinking it would drop more and then I got busy in July with my new baby. I barely checked market and news in July and first week of August until last Monday when QQQ was 315 and SPY was 410 and I said to myself this will likely pullback and then I will start buying, but I was definitely wrong and market kept ripping.

Now everything is overvalued again. Forward S&amp;P 500 P/E is close to 19 which is high while Fed is hiking. AAPL is few dollars to ATH. MSFT is close to 290. TSLA is 900.

I am not an expert, but I cannot wrap my head around this massive rally. Fed is still hiking. Inflation seemed to have peaked but too soon to tell before August CPI.  However, it does not seem we will revisit June bottom, and that is ok, but I am hoping for a pullback in S&amp;P to below 4000.

My current plan is to start small DCA'ing next week and wait until September (most volatile month and before next fed meeting) and start buying at lump sums if S&amp;P 500 goes below 4000.

&amp;#x200B;

But are you buying (not scalping) at these levels? and if so, why do you think market might further rip from here while Fed is still hiking with no signs of pivot and economy is still slowing?

&amp;#x200B;

Stocks traded mostly higher on Wednesday, with all three major indexes extending yesterdays gains, as market participants digested FDA approval of a Pfizers (PFE) oral coronavirus treatment and new reports about US gross-domestic product (GDP) and consumer confidence.

**Notable Numbers**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +1.00%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): +1.22%
* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.71%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +0.99%
* Volatility Index (VIX): -5.77%
* Tesla (TSLA): +7.49%
* Alibaba (BABA): -4.07%
* AMC: -5.35%

Pfizers antiviral COVID-19 pill for at-risk people aged 12 and above was authorized by the FDA , making it the first oral treatment which can be taken at home, providing a potentially important tool in the fight against the fast-spreading Omicron variant.

The pill, called Paxlovid, was nearly 90% effective in preventing hospitalizations and deaths in patients at high risk of severe illness, according to data from the company's clinical trial. Recent lab data suggests the drug retains its effectiveness against Omicron, Pfizer said.

[https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizer-oral-covid-19-pill-gets-us-authorization-at-home-use-2021-12-22/](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/pfizer-oral-covid-19-pill-gets-us-authorization-at-home-use-2021-12-22/)

Omicron has overtaken other coronavirus variants to become the dominant strain in the U.S., and now accounts for about three-quarters of new infections, according to the CDC. To fight this, the Biden administration announced it was buying 500 million at-home rapid coronavirus tests that Amercians will be able to order online for free starting in January.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/finance/news/cdc-omicron-accounted-73-recent-230445514.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/finance/news/cdc-omicron-accounted-73-recent-230445514.html)

In the latest estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, third-quarter U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) was revised higher. Analysts now expect GDP to show a 2.3% annualized increase in economic activity in Q3, up from the 2.1% rise previously estimated.

The Conference Boards highly anticipated Consumer Confidence Index report showed a greater than expected increase in December. The institution's headline index crept higher to 115.8 in December, based on the latest release. This was above the 111.0 expected, according to Bloomberg consensus data.

Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, said Consumer confidence improved further in December, following a very modest gain in November. Expectations about short-term growth prospects improved, setting the stage for continued growth in early 2022. The proportion of consumers planning to purchase homes, automobiles, major appliances, and vacations over the next six months all increased.

She continued, Meanwhile, concerns about inflation declined after hitting a 13-year high last month as did concerns about COVID-19, despite reports of continued price increases and the emergence of the Omicron variant,"" Franco added. Looking ahead to 2022, both confidence and consumer spending will continue to face headwinds from rising prices and an expected winter surge of the pandemic.

**Highlights**

* Existing home sales increased by 1.9% to reach a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 6.46 million units in November, [the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/existing-home-sales-november-2021-150006550.html) Consensus economists were looking for a 2.9% increase, according to Bloomberg data. Existing home sales in October had risen at a 0.8% monthly rate.
* Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rallied after CEO Elon Musk tweeted that he has sold enough stock.
* shares fell Wednesday following reports that Chinas IT regulator suspended partnership with the company for six months for failing to report an open-source security vulnerability to the government.
* Nio announced that it received the U.N. certification on cybersecurity management, which is a major global mandatory regulation with regards to cybersecurity. It is widely applicable in countries such as the EU, the U.K., Japan and South Korea.
* The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has denied Apple Inc's bid to exclude a shareholder proposal that would require the company to inform investors about its use of non-disclosure agreements and other concealment clauses, according to a document viewed by Reuters.

Stocks edged higher today in a very volatile session, with the three main indexes (S&amp;P 500 (SPY), Nasdaq (QQQ), Dow Jones (DIA) falling at open before reversing to the upside mid-session, a sign that market participants remain eager to buy up any dip. On the other hand, the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, broke its two day rally, trading 1.75% lower at the time of writing. Market participants continue to weight a variety of factors, including but not limited to: (1) faster-than-expected pace of economic recovery, (2) surging corporate earnings, (3) potential inflationary pressures, (4) labor market imbalances, and (5) concerns surrounding the coronavirus delta variant. Basically, the market is balancing between expectations for rapid economic expansion moving forward and concerns surrounding inflation and the delta variant.

Today, the Labor Department released the Weekly Unemployment report, which unfortunately, showed an unexpected rise in new jobless claims filed. New jobless claims jumped to 419,000, well above consensus estimates of 360,000 and a sharp jump from the previous week, which showed pandemic-era lows in claims filed. Since the beginning of the pandemic, market participants have closely tracked these numbers in order to gauge the health of the labor market. However, with rising infections threatening to trigger new restrictions, labor market reports have taken on more importance than usual.

In the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 32,300 on July 18, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. However, as I said yesterday, it is important to understand that the rising infections are broadly concentrated in areas with higher vaccine hesitancy. According to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, There is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated. Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.

In other news, Q2 earnings season continues full steam ahead, with the quarter shaping up to be another record-setting one. Earnings are expected to be super-charged by higher than expected demand from savings-laden consumers as the economy reopens. While concerns around the delta variant have put a damper on sentiment, reports by companies have not reflected any slowdown in growth. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data  an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher."" 

**Highlights**

* Shares of Twitter (TWTR) and Snapchat (SNAP) skyrocketed after-hours after the companies reported better than expected earnings and raised guidance moving forward.
* Shares of Dominos Pizza (DPZ) skyrocketed after smashing earnings estimates and announcing a new share buyback program
* US Senators introduced a bill that would amend Section 230, the well-known law that gives social media companies immunity from what users post on their platform, to hold companies liable for health-related misinformation.
* Websites of several airlines, banks and technology companies, including Amazon's AWS, Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Express (AXP), were facing outages, according to DownDetector. So far, Ive been unable to find the cause.
* Bank of America (BAC) on Wednesday said its board approved a 17% increase to the company's quarterly cash dividend.
* U antitrust regulators are set to give unconditional approval to Irish aircraft leasing company AerCap's (AER) $30 billion bid for General Electric's (GE) aircraft leasing business, three people familiar with the matter said.
* Ford (F), startup Argo AI, and Lyft (LYFT) are reportedly working together to launch a self-driving ride-hailing service in Miami, Florida and Austin, Texas later this year. At first, there will be a safety driver behind the wheel but reportedly want fully automated robotaxis by 2022 or 2023.

So-called stay-at-home stocks, which greatly outperformed the market during the depth of the pandemic, have cratered back to Earth, with many trading at or around pre-pandemic levels. Shares of Netflix (NFLX) fell roughly 23% lower after the company posted a disappointing subscriber growth numbers, with the company projecting 2.5 million new users for the first quarter of 2022 versus the 6.3 million anticipated, according to Bloomberg data. Shares of Disney (DIS) and Roku (ROKU) fell in sympathy.

Meanwhile, Peloton (PTON) stock has fallen below its IPO price after the company after the company announced it was cutting production of its product, citing waning demand. 

Mark Luschini, Chief Investment Strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, said It is hese infamous stay-at-home plays ... that had been bid up to valuations that get to the point where they're priced for perfection. Anything that is released about the companies' investment results or prospects that doesn't meet or exceed very elevated expectations leads to gigantic disappointment in the form of a share price decline.

Recent market volatility can be attributed to the multidecade jump in consumer and producer prices reported last week, which served as a reminder that inflation remains the key driver of risk and uncertainty in the year ahead. 

The consumer price index (CPI) rose 7% in December compared to a year ago, the fastest pace of increase since 1982 and the eighth straight month in which inflation exceeded 5%. Excluding the volatile categories of food and energy, core CPI rose 5.5%, the most since 1991.

Like last year, inflation in the prices of goods played a large part in the jump. For example, prices of used cars and trucks soared 37%, and furniture prices rose 14% from a year ago. While pandemic-related supply-and-demand imbalances continue to drive prices for durable goods higher, services inflation is also strengthening but to a lesser extent, rising 3.7% in December. 

On the other hand, the producer price index (PPI) showed a 9.7% year-over-year increase in prices paid by producers, the biggest jump since 2010. Core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, came in at 8.3%.

The extent to the rise in prices caused the Fed to pivot to a more hawkish stance, with policy suggesting the Central Bank stance is shifting from supporting the economy and the labor market to combating ongoing inflation. With higher prices persisting at a higher level than originally expected, members of the Fed are now calling for three to four interest rate hikes next year, with the earliest projected for March 2022. 

Jeffrey Kleintop, Chief Global Investment Strategist at Charles Schwab, said I think there is a rotation going on towards those areas of the market that have been neglected for a long time  not just months, but years. Areas like financials and energy. Even health care, which is an area that had done a bit better during the pandemic really isn't seeing any kind of multiples as it did in the past. I think those areas of the market have more durability here as we look at an environment where earnings growth is slowing so valuations matter more,"" he added. ""And many of these companies can look to generate earnings growth in this environment of rising interest rates and commodity prices, whereas tech is a bit more challenged as goods demand begins to slow.""

A gauge of future U.S. economic activity increased solidly in December, suggesting the expansion would continue despite challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic and anticipated interest rate increases from the Federal Reserve to tame high inflation. 

The Conference Board's closely watched[ Leading Economic Index (LEI) ](https://www.conference-board.org/data/bcicountry.cfm?cid=1)rose 0.8% in December, matching consensus estimates, according to Bloomberg data. This picked up from November's 0.7% clip, which was downwardly revised from the 1.1% gain previously reported. 

Ataman Ozyildirim, Senior Director of Economic Research at the Conference Board, said The U.S. LEI ended 2021 on a rising trajectory, suggesting the economy will continue to expand well into the spring. For the first quarter, headwinds from the Omicron variant, labor shortages, and inflationary pressuresas well as the Federal Reserves expected interest rate hikesmay moderate economic growth. The Conference Board forecasts GDP growth for Q1 2022 to slow to a relatively healthy 2.2 percent (annualized). Still, for all of 2022, we forecast the US economy will expand by a robust 3.5 percentwell above the pre-pandemic trend growth.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 26, 2021**

Stocks mostly consolidated today, finishing modestly higher led by a 0.34% gain in the Nasdaq (QQQ). After the volatility experienced in the first weeks of May it is very encouraging to see market volatility calming down and holding on to recent gains. Market participants continue to closely monitor incoming inflation data, though it seems fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy have tempered.

New economic data released yesterday shows consumer confidence dipped in April, compared to March, even as more social distancing restrictions were lifted across the US. The Conference Board (a non-profit research organization), released their April Consumer Confidence index which showed sentiment falling steeper than expected. The report showed the consumer confidence index dipped to 117.2 in May from 117.5 in April. However, on the positive side, April's reading was the highest since February 2020, before the start of Covid-19 lockdowns. Economists expected consumer confidence to rise to 119.5. 

Yesterday, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be mostly temporary and that the Fed was not quite there yet when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation. 

Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said there will come a time in upcoming meetings when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that it is going to depend on the flow of data. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.

This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldnt worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.

Stocks largely finished higher, with all three major indexes managing to close out the day in the green. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) once again recorded fresh intraday highs.  The Nasdaq (QQQ) broke two consecutive red days and finished higher today. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, underperformed relative to the major indexes, closing the day 0.26% down. It seems a pattern has emerged in the last week or so, in which the market pulls back early in the morning before reversing to the upside. Market participants continue to weigh new economic data and corporate earnings with concerns around the coronavirus Delta variant and potential inflationary pressures. 

Yesterday, The Labor Department reported Wednesday that its consumer price index (CPI) rose 5.4% in July from a year earlier, in line with Junes figure and matching the largest jump since August 2008. The government said CPI increased 0.5% on a month-over-month basis, matching a consensus forecast from economists surveyed by Dow Jones.

Core CPI which excludes energy and food, rose by 0.3% last month, shy of a forecasted 0.4% increase and well below Junes rise of 0.9%. The core figure is up 4.3% over the last year, a slight deceleration from Junes 4.5%. Economists often consider core CPI to be a more reliable indicator since its insulated from the frequent swings in petroleum and food prices. Its encouraging to see prices slowly moderate as the economic recovery continues to mature and pent-up consumer demand is increasingly released. 

The US Senate gave surprisingly bipartisan approval to a $1 trillion infrastructure bill. The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nations roads and bridges, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nations broadband infrastrucutre. The vote, 69-30, was uncommonly bipartisan given the seeming contention the Republicans had for the initial drafts of the infrastructure bill. President Biden said, This historic investment in infrastructure is what I believe you, the American people, want, what youve been asking for for a long, long time. Mitch McConnell, who earlier in the year publicly declared 100% of my focus is on stopping this new administration said of the deal, I was proud to support todays historic  bipartisan infrastructure and prove that both sides of the political aisle can still come together around common-sense solutions. The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nations roads and bridges, bolster public transportation, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nations broadband and 5G infrastrucutre.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, December 30, 2021**

After starting the day green, stocks closed modestly lower, slipping in the last few hours of the session as market participants digested newly released labor market data and surging coronavirus cases across the world due to the Omicron variant. 

Given we are in the last few session of the year, volume had dried up considerably. For example, in the last four or five trading sessions, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has traded roughly half its average volume. The fact that stocks are holding up so well despite volume drying up is very encouraging going into next year.

**Notable Numbers** 

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -0.28%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -0.35%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.24%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.04%
* Volatility Index (VIX): +2.36%
* Sea Limited (SE): +4.86%
* SoFi Technologies: +10.02%
* Upstart (UPST): +4.97%
* Affirm (AFRM): +5.63%
* Biogen (BIIB): -7.09%
* DraftKings (DKNG): +7.07%

On Monday, global COVID-19 cases hit a daily record, with more than 1.44 million infections reported worldwide.  Infections from the highly-transmissible Omicron variant  found to spread 70 times faster than previous strains  comprised much of the newly tracked cases. 

[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue)

In response, airlines canceled thousands of flights, both domestic and international, and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officially advised people to avoid cruise ships regardless of vaccination status. As a result, both airline and cruise line stocks underperformed the market. On a personal note, after the last two years, I couldnt get paid to go on a cruise. 

Despite this, the CDC eased guidelines for quarantining after exposure to Omicron, halving its recommended isolation time from 10 days down to 5 days. 

Data shows that the majority of coronavirus transmission ""occurs early in the course of illness,"" the CDC explained  generally in the one or two days before symptoms begin and two or three days after.

""Therefore, people who test positive should isolate for 5 days and, if asymptomatic at that time, they may leave isolation if they can continue to mask for 5 days to minimize the risk of infecting others,"" the CDC said in a statement.

In other news, the Labor Department released its weekly unemployment report, showing initial and continuing jobless claims continue to come in at historic lows, signaling a tight labor market.  First-time unemployment filings fell further from last weeks reading, coming in at 198,000  below the expected 206,000. Earlier in December, jobless claims fell to 188,000  its lowest level since 1969.

Meanwhile, in a regulatory filing on Thursday, Samsung BioLogics denied earlier reports that Samsung subsidiary was in talks to acquire U.S. drugmaker Biogen (BIIB), which was in the spotlight on Wednesday after shares of the drugmaker surged during intraday trading following a report by the Korea Economic Daily, which cited investment banking sources. The report said Biogen approached Samsung to buy its shares in a deal that could be valued at more than $42 billion.

The wild swings in the market continue, with three indexes bouncing back after yesterdays selloff. With the market fluctuating so wildly, it is difficult to pinpoint the reasons behind this price action, but I think there are two main, competing factors contributing to the volatility the market has seen in the last two weeks or so. It seems that fears inflation, marked by high prints in the consumer price index yesterday, are causing concern that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy sooner than expected and is pushing the market down while the April Job Report, which missed analyst estimates and marked a sharp declaration in job growth compared to March, bolsters confidence in the Feds claim that it will not consider tightening monetary policy until it sees a string of strong labor reports. Again though, with so many factors revolving around the market, it is difficult to see the clear picture.

The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 1.17% up after closing 2.09% down yesterday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.77% up after closing 2.54% down yesterday. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed 1.26% up after closing 2% down yesterday. 

Yesterday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index (CPI), which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

Today, the producer price index (PPI), which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers has increased more than expected. 

However, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be transitory as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a string of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. In an April 28 meeting Powell said, Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.

Moreover, the April Job Report, released last Friday, showed the US economy only added 266,000 new jobs last month, missing estimates of more than 1 million jobs gained and marking a sharp deceleration from Marchs total of 916,000 new jobs added. As said earlier, members of the Federal Reserve, including Powell, have consistently reiterated they want to see a   
String of strong labor reports before considering any changes to the current policy. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, theres a very large group of people who are not. The April Job Report bolsters Powells argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper well before the interest rate is increased. He said, We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance. In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, Im fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner than expected are overblown. Looking ahead though, I expect the kangaroo market to continue in the near term. Just my two cents.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 15, 2021**

*Sorry for not posting the recap yesterday, with the market bouncing so hard decide to take a day off and treat myself!*

Stocks rose on Friday, continuing a monster bounce in October that has seen the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) claw back a lot of the losses suffered in September, and finish the week 2% higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ), which fell as much as 8% from its previous peak, closed the week a remarkable 2.65% higher while the Dow Jones (DIA) closed the week 1.49% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed the week 1.43% higher. Market participants are encouraged by an unexpected rise in retail sales in the US and a stronger-than-expected start to earnings season, which kicked off this week with big banks reporting. 

Not to toot my own horn, but as I have continuously said, I continue to see any dips in the markets as buying opportunities, including this latest dip. While I understood and have written extensively about the current risk factors in the market (China, inflation, supply-chain issues, etc), these are all issues that have been known about and have been affecting the market for months. Just because we see a sudden uptick in doomsaying headlines from mass media, doesnt mean the fundamentals of the bull market in US equities have shifted (remember they are paid for you to engage with the content). Until something fundamentally changes (like inflation forcing the Fed to suddenly hike the interest rate), I continue to stick to my plan. Just be sure to be prepared for any eventuality, I do this by having zero margin in my long-term account and adhering to stop losses in trades.

The Department of Commerce released their monthly report on retail sales, which showed an unexpected rise in consumer spending in September despite supply-chain constraints. Retail sales for the month increased by 0.7%, against the Dow Jones estimate for a decline of 0.2%. Compared with a year ago, sales were up 13.9%. Still despite robust consumer spending, economists warn that supply bottlenecks will increase heading into the holiday season, as demand increases. Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets said,  The solid retail sales report reflects both consumer resilience and escalating prices. The main concern now is that supply-chain disruption and micro-chip shortages appear to be spreading, limiting selection and tamping down goods demand. 

This week's early batch of stronger-than-anticipated quarterly results has helped assuage investors' concerns over a sharp deceleration in corporate profits, especially as expenses mount for companies across industries in the face of higher input and labor costs. 

So far, Wall Street analysts are looking for third-quarter earnings growth of about 27% on a year-over-year basis, [according to FactSet data. ](https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_100821.pdf)Though this would still be the third-fastest earnings growth rate since 2010, it would be a marked slowdown from the second quarter's nearly 90% pace. 

**Highlights**

* Big US banks kicked off earnings season with a bang, with XLF, the ETF tracking all banks in the SP 500, jumping to record levels. 
* In a statement, Amazon-owned streaming platform Twitch confirmed that last weeks data breach contained the companys source code, but insisted that passwords, credit card info, and other sensitive info was not compromised.
* Shares of Disney (DIS) spiked after unconfirmed reports that the company planned to spin off its ESPN operations. Reports later come out to discredit the original report so it remains unclear if anything is actually happening.
* Chinese EV company NIO reportedly plans to increase production capacity by 20% at their main factory and aim for another 100% rise by mid-2022. Shares of the company are up 4% on the news.
* Microsoft (MSFT) is shutting down operations of business social media LinkedIn in China following increased regulatory scrutiny, but the company still has other operations within the country
* Disney (DIS) has unveiled a line-up of more than 20 new content titles from the Asia-Pacific region, including 18 original productions, that will be streamed over its Disney+ service. This is likely in response to the unprecedented success of Netflixs (NFLX) Squid Game, which rapidly became the companys most viewed showed ever.
* Twitter (TWTR) said it was rolling out new ad features and revamping the algorithm that decides which ads as the company deepens its push for monetization and launch new eCommerce features.

The stock market rose again today, driven by a continued rally in tech stocks and tempered inflationary fears. The Nasdaq (QQQ) reached a fresh record high for the second time this week and the Dow Jones (DIA) continues to recover following its worst week since October 2020. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.54% higher and is two points away from its record high. With earnings for Q2 fast approaching, market participants are gearing up for what is expected to be a repeat of Q1 record-setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data  an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher."" 

Today, in a meeting with the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell once again reiterated that interest rates will not be raised on inflation fears alone and sees current pressures as transitory. Powell said, We will not raise interest rates preemptively because we fear the possible onset of inflation. We will wait for evidence of actual inflation or other imbalances. He went on to further say recent price increases dont speak to a broadly tight economy that would require higher interest rates but come from factors directly affected by the reopening. Powell then went on to further reiterate the Central Bank is keeping a close eye on a broad set of labor market statistics before any adjustment to the current policy is considered. He said We will not just look at the headline numbers for unemployment. We will look at all kinds of measures&. That is the most important thing we can do to ensure the benefits of the recovery are more fully shared. 

As expected, response by lawmakers to Powells testimony, no surprise, split squarely down partisan lines, with Democrats focusing on labor market imbalances and unemployment and Republicans focusing on concerns surrounding inflation. I do not place much, if any, weight on what was said by lawmakers, just interested in what Powell had to say. 

On Thursday, the Fed is set to release the results of its stress test on the US largest banks, an annual test meant to test the financial health of lenders that was instituted following the 2009 financial crisis. The tests are designed to see how banks would fare during a hypothetical extreme economic downturn (not unlike what banks experienced last year). This stress test is extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Thanks to those measures, plus low interest rates and government stimulus that held off loan losses, analysts expect banks to perform well on Thursday, which would lead the Fed to lift remaining capital distribution curbs, opening the floodgates for banks to increase dividends and reinstitute stock buy back programs. If these restrictions are fully lifted, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters. This is huge.

Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting ""base effects"" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the boar

"33","2021-10-28",1635451301,"PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, October 28, 2021","Stocks continued their remarkable rally, with all three major indexes rising and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) reaching a fresh intraday high amid continued strength by mega-cap tech stocks during earnings. This is despite new economic data that showed US GDP slowdown to its slowest expansion rate in over a year and new weekly unemployment claims. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, outperformed the major indexes on the day. Looking ahead, market participants continue to digest the ongoing corporate earning season.

The GDP report showed the economy decelerated to expand at the slowest rate in over one year for the July through September quarter, with the Delta variant and supply-side constraints capping economic activity. GDP rose at a 2.0% annualized rate, missing estimates for the 2.6% pace consensus economists anticipated. However, despite this report and other recent tepid economic data, market participants have remained remarkably resilient and kept buying up any dips.

Earlier in the week, the Conference Board, a non-profit business research organization, released their October monthly consumer confidence index, which showed confidence rising as coronavirus cases in the US continued to retreat from the latest spike. Cases in the US retreated from a high in the previous spike of 285,058 to 105,561 in between September 13 and October 25. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 113.8 in October from 109.8 in September. This came in higher than the 108.0 consensus economists were looking for, according to Bloomberg data. It also marked the first monthly increase in confidence since June.  

The latest batch of earnings results helped affirm to Wall Street that many companies will be able to work through rising price pressures to continue delivering estimates-topping sales and profits. Though the expectation is that  inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions could last for longer than previously anticipated, the impacts will be surmountable to most companies. 

Lori Calvasina, Chief Equity Strategist at RBC Capital Markets, said What weve got from these supply chain issues is a near-term earnings problem. I think it's something we do have to monitor in the first half of the year. Earnings growth is only tracking at 4% or 6% in the first two quarters of next year. So companies do have to keep managing through for the market to continue to move up. But the reality is that the underlying economic backdrop simply is not stagnant. I really just dont buy into that stagflation argument at all.

Stocks traded higher in another record-setting session in the market. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow (DIA) both recorded new intraday highs and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) kept building on recent momentum. Market participants continue to digest remarks from members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. 

The equity market got a boost after FOMC members signaled in their March meeting that the Fed continues to favor maintaining highly accommodative monetary policies for the foreseeable future and signaling they will hold off on tightening policy at the first sights of inflation. Jerome Powell reiterated that the Federal reserve was looking for actual progress rather than forecasts to before the Central Bank considers tightening monetary policy. Moreover, Powell highlighted the uneven recovery in the US labor market as a sign the economic recovery still has a ways to go in order to meet the Federal Reserves employment goals. He said The recovery though here remains uneven and incomplete. Tee burden is still falling on lower-income workers. The unemployment rate in the bottom quartile is still 20%. There are still eight and a half million people out of work. This unevenness that were talking about is a very serious issue. 

Treasury yields have come back down some, hovering at 1.66% at the time of writing, as fears over a near-term policy shift by the Federal Reserve dissipated, prompting market participants to rotate back to growth and mega-cap tech stocks, with Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Facebook (FB) reaching new intra-day records. Colleen MacPherson, Penobscot Investment Management portfolio manager said, Weve seen this rotation into more value-oriented names from growth to value, but as we enter into earnings season, we anticipate growth names to see somewhat of a rebound because we expect strong earnings coming out of the growth names. But overall, I think the trend into value, small caps, more cyclical names will continue as the economy reopens and more people are inoculated and we get back to normalcy.

Looking ahead, market participants will be closely monitoring the upcoming earnings season for the first three months (Q1) of 2021. Over the past several weeks, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by record levels with the expectation that recent economic growth will drive corporate earnings higher. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far. Omar Aguilar, chief investment officer at Charles Schwab said, Were still in probably the early parts of the expansionary cyclical after recovering from that recession. Weve started to see cyclical trades playing a big role in the early part of the cycle. Normally what happens at this stage is you continue to see & the cyclical component will continue to drive leadership into the second part of this year into next year.

"35","2021-10-01",1633131943,"Rising bond yields: what they mean and how to play this","**TL;DR: Rising bond yields means investors should rotate from growth to value. Avoid ARK ETFs at all costs, they have underperformed for a reason. We have yet to see capitulation.** 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure you've all seen the headlines over the past week or so about rising bond yields, and I'm honestly surprised that the majority of investors I've talked to don't know how this affects their stock allocations. They read about the rising bond yields and how that hurts growth stocks, but the articles never dive into exactly why this happens. I felt compelled to write this post because I found out my mother put the majority of her 401K into QQQ, ARKK, and ARKG back in July. The recent downwards move in these names has her spooked, and on the phone she mentioned she has no idea why these ETFs (ARKK and ARKG in particular) are going down more than the rest of the market.

&amp;#x200B;

To preface this post, this is not financial advice and I'm not a financial advisor. But I have been investing my own money for the better part of the past two decades and have seen long term success. I've learned a lot from my friends who work in the industry over the years so hopefully I can shed some light on how institutions, the ones driving the market, operate. I commonly rotate my investments based on what I've learned and macroeconomic variables in order to achieve a more optimal strategic positioning in the market.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, onto rising bond yields. This site lets you see the yields for notes of various maturities: [https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-bond-yield](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-bond-yield). All of the bond yields have risen this past week, but the one of particular concern is the yield on the 2 YR treasury note. It hasn't been this high since March 2020, and analysts are projecting it will rise even higher.

&amp;#x200B;

This move was fueled by fears of more persistent inflation, the upcoming taper that will begin after the November Fed meeting, and the prospect of rate hikes coming sooner than originally anticipated.  The Fed isn't alone either. Central Banks all around the world have signaled plans to tighten monetary policy: the BoE for example [https://www.ft.com/content/80de9d5d-42c5-47f0-bc86-a46d05291691](https://www.ft.com/content/80de9d5d-42c5-47f0-bc86-a46d05291691), Brazil (except no one really cares about Brazil) [https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banks/monetary-policy/monetary-policy-decisions/7863731/brazil-accelerates-tightening-cycle-with-100bp-rate-hike](https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banks/monetary-policy/monetary-policy-decisions/7863731/brazil-accelerates-tightening-cycle-with-100bp-rate-hike), and countries in the Eurozone [https://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-bonds/update-3-euro-zone-yields-continue-to-climb-after-german-election-idUSL1N2QT0JH](https://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-bonds/update-3-euro-zone-yields-continue-to-climb-after-german-election-idUSL1N2QT0JH).

&amp;#x200B;

Fed officials at the most recent meeting moved up their expectations for a rate hike in 2022 and increased the number of rate hikes expected in 2023 ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/22/fed-powell-taper-rate-hike/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/22/fed-powell-taper-rate-hike/)). If inflation continues to persist, which is likely due to strong demand-pull and supply-side constraints like the disruptions we're seeing in Southeast Asia due to Covid, then we'll see these rate hike expectations move forward even more. A higher federal funds rate results in higher bond yields.

&amp;#x200B;

The market digested this information from last week and it is now being priced into the market. So why do growth stocks get hammered more than the rest of the market when bond yields rise? Even today, for October 1st, the NASDAQ rose 0.65% while the S&amp;P 500 rose a whopping 1.23%.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason is because of how companies are fundamentally valued. After all, the market isn't a casino, even though it can seem like it at times. Shout out to GME and AMC. So what does a company's stock price really represent?

&amp;#x200B;

Fundamentally, a company's stock price represents the present value of its future cash flows. This valuation method is commonly used in the industry and is known as a discounted cash flow (read [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) if you want to expand on this even more but I'll summarize). Basically, how do you calculate the **present** value of **future** cash flows? You take those future cash flows and you *discount* them by the risk free rate, often represented by bond yields. The reason we do this discounting is because that future cash flow is worth less BECAUSE it happens in the future. That money, if available in the present, could have generated the risk free rate each year.

Let's look at an example to see how discounting works. Let us assume stock A is expected to produce cash flow of $100 in 2022, $200 in 2023, and $500 in 2024 and the risk free rate is 1%.

&amp;#x200B;

We get: Discounted Cash Flow until 2024 = $100/1.01 + $200/(1.01)\^2 + $500/(1.01)\^3 = $780

&amp;#x200B;

But what happens if the risk free rate increases to 2%?

&amp;#x200B;

Then we get: Discounted Cash Flow until 2024 = $100/1.02 + $200/(1.02)\^2 + $500/(1.02)\^3 = $761

&amp;#x200B;

The key takeaway from this is that rising bond yields mean future cash flows will be worth less at present. The reason growth stocks get so hammered on moves in bond yields is because the majority of their cash flow comes in the future, and that's why they can be valued so richly when bond yields are at record lows (like through all of 2020 and the beginning of 2021). Take Nikola, for example, it currently has no free cash flow but it's valued because it promises future free cash flow. Quantumscape, TuSimple, and so many more names fall into this category.

&amp;#x200B;

Growth stocks have fallen out of favor for this reason and is why ARKK, ARKG, and all of the other ARK ETFs have already dropped over 20% from their all time highs. The concentration of growth stocks in the NASDAQ is also the reason for its underperformance this past week.

&amp;#x200B;

Reddit forums always scream, ""don't fight the FED,"" and they're right. For times like these, it's best to rotate out of growth and into value names. The Fed TELLS you what they're going to do and this past Fed meeting was the most hawkish Fed meeting I've listened to in a long time. I'm not claiming that markets will crash, far from it, I'm simply claiming that growth stocks are not where you want to be.

This is going to hit a capitulation point when bond yields rise even more. This Twitter post shows the underperformance of ARKK's investments: [https://twitter.com/TheMarketDog/status/1443154120047828994/photo/2](https://twitter.com/TheMarketDog/status/1443154120047828994/photo/2). The only reason ARK is even alive is because of Tesla, and rising bond yields will eventually catch up to Tesla too, which is currently valued at 400x PE. You might be thinking now is a good time to pick up these names at a discount, but that would be ill-advised. If you're planning to hold for the next decade and through a potential 50-90% drawdown, then go ahead.

&amp;#x200B;

There's a reason Michael Burry has been shorting ARKK ([https://www.yahoo.com/now/ark-innovation-etf-sell-big-210000360.html](https://www.yahoo.com/now/ark-innovation-etf-sell-big-210000360.html)) and one of the largest positions in his fund is a Tesla short ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/michael-burry-of-the-big-short-reveals-a-530-million-bet-against-tesla.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/michael-burry-of-the-big-short-reveals-a-530-million-bet-against-tesla.html)) specifically because he foresees an unfavorable environment for growth stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

If you've been wondering why SPACs have been dying, this is why.

&amp;#x200B;

If you've been wondering why your growth stocks have been dying, this is why.

&amp;#x200B;

If you've been debating whether or not to sell your ARK ETFs, this is why. Cathie Wood is simply a marketing genius who got lucky off moonshot plays in Bitcoin and Tesla, and then leveraged that success to convince the public to drive in-flows into her ARK ETFs over the past years. Those inflows helped propel a bunch of growth names higher, but ARK will eventually be a victim of its own success as outflows force selling into already declining stock prices. This reddit post is from February of 2021 when ARKK died because of, you guessed it, rising bond yields: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lv1sjx/investors\_beware\_arkk\_is\_a\_liquidity\_disaster/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lv1sjx/investors_beware_arkk_is_a_liquidity_disaster/). Looking at the 2 YR yield, this time might be significantly worse. This is why I told my mother to move everything over to $VTI and a selection of value names: $ADNT, $GM, $F, $KRE, $HEES, $HRI, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

The ONLY stock in ARKK with a reasonable PE multiple is COIN. Every other name has a multiple in either the high-flying hundreds, or the stock is simply a money burning piece of shit experiencing slowing growth. GL investors - stay safe out there. If you've been holding ARKK, it's okay to take a loss. When investing, and over the long run, losses are bound to happen. My biggest losses all came from holding onto the hope that my stock would recover, even though I knew deep down it wouldn't.

Despite some volatility earlier in the week, stocks firmly rose today as market participants looked beyond slightly disappointing GDP and jobs data and the Federal Reserves July Monetary Policy, which showed no changes but did indicate members are increasingly considering the potential timeline to taper quantitative easing (QE). In my opinion, the fact that markets continue to shrug off volatility to charge higher shows great relative strength and signals that market participants remain willing and able to buy dips. 

The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) both recorded fresh all-time highs, closing 0.4% and 0.42% higher respectively. The Nasdaq (QQQ) is right under its own record high and closed the day 0.18% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, outperformed again, closing 0.77% higher.

Today, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis released its advanced estimate of second-quarter gross-domestic-product (GDP) growth. Despite accelerating from the first-quarter, economists were largely expecting a higher jump, despite consumer spending, the largest component of US economic activity, beating expectations. However, it seems market participants were not fazed. Here are the numbers:

* **Q2 GDP, seasonally adjusted annualized quarter-over-quarter:** 6.5% vs. 8.4% expected and a downwardly revised 6.3% in Q1
* **Personal consumption:** 11.8% vs. 10.5% expected and 11.4% in Q1
* **Core personal consumption expenditures, quarter-over-quarter:** 6.0% vs. 6.1% expected and an upwardly revised 2.7% in Q1

Market participants are digesting the Federal Reserves July Monetary Policy Report, released yesterday, which largely reiterated what members of the Fed have been saying for months, but did include some new language hinting that the economic recovery is getting closer to the Feds stated goals. The statement read, Last December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgagebacked securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals. Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals, and the Committee will continue to assess progress in coming meetings. In other words, the Fed says substantial progress has been made and that in the coming months, we will increasingly begin to hear more about a timeline to taper quantitative easing. 

On inflation, the statement largely reiterated what it has in months past. The statement read, Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses and The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longerterm inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved.

However, the report did acknowledge potential risks and stated the Fed was ready to act if appropriate risks arise. The statement read, In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

Amazon (AMZN) absolutely smashed earnings, posting probably the most impressive quarter I have ever seen. Despite this, the stock is currently down 5% after some analysts raised concerns about a slowdown in growth moving forward due to reopenings and difficult comparisons. Personally, with numbers like this, I am going to snap up any dip if it continues tomorrow. Here are the numbers:

* **Revenue:** $115.06 billion expected versus $88.91 billion in Q2 2020
* **EPS:** $15.75 expected versus $10.30 in Q2 2020
* **AWS revenue:** $14.18 billion expected versus $10.81 billion in Q2 2020

In other news, the Labor Department Weekly Unemployment Report came in higher than expected. Here are the numbers 

* **New Jobless Claims:** 400,000 vs 385,000 expected
* **Continuing Claims:** 3.269 million vs 3.183 million expected

**Highlights**

* Yesterday, shares of Facebook (FB), which recently joined the $1 trillion market-cap club, fell after the company warned of a significant slowdown in growth moving forward and suggested that Apples (AAPL) newest iOS app-tracking update, which lets users opt out of having apps track their activity outside their own platform, would negatively impact their core advertising business. Here are the numbers
   * **Earnings:** $3.61 per share, adjusted, vs. $3.03 per share as expected\\
   * **Revenue:** $29.08 billion, vs. $27.89 billion as expected by analysts
   * **Daily active users (DAUs):** 1.91 billion, vs. 1.91 billion as expected
   * **Monthly active users (MAUs):** 2.90 billion, vs. 2.91 billion as expected
   * **Average revenue per user (ARPU):** $10.12, vs. $9.66 as expected 
* PayPal (PYPL) also reported earnings, which were largely in-line with expectations. As a result, stock fell roughly 5% today. Personally, that move seems a little overdone to me.
* Today was the highly anticipated IPO of Robinhood (HOOD), popular brokerage that has garnered a horrendous reputation among many retail traders, particularly those who invest in meme stocks. Like I have said before, personally not touching that stock with a 10-foot pole, too many dynamics at play. But it will still be fun to keep track of.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, September 13, 2021**

*My bad for the late post, I had the recap written and sent it out, just forgot to post it here. Apologies*

After being negative through most of the day, the three major indexes reversed in the last hour of the market in order to snap a five-day consecutive losing streak, the longest since February. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.25% up, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed even while the Dow Jones (DIA) broke its recent streak of relative underperformance to close 0.74% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed 0.58% higher. 

Last week, new economic data showed that prices paid by producers for materials once again rose last month, once again highlighting the strain that stills exists as supply-side pressures and labor market shortages once again push inflationary readings higher. This report shows that, despite the pandemic surging once again, demand by consumers remains red-hot and continues to outstrip manufacturing capacity, causing shortages, which, as basic economics shows, pushes prices higher. The producer price index for final demand rose 0.7% last month after two straight monthly increases of 1.0%, the Labor Department said. The gain was led by a 0.7% advance in services following a 1.1% jump in July. A 1.5% increase in trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers, accounted for two-thirds of the broad rise in services. Goods prices jumped 1.0% after climbing 0.6% in July, with food rebounding 2.9%. In the 12 months through August, the PPI accelerated 8.3%, the biggest year-on-year advance since November 2010, though one has to take into account this number is inflated due to easy comparisons to last year, given the absolute collapse of prices during the height of the pandemic before the vaccine existed. Economists had forecast a rise of 0.6% on a monthly basis and 8.2% on a yearly basis, basically in line with reality. 

Mike Loewengart, Managing Director at E-Trade Financial, said of the PPI, Anyone who has bought pretty much everything recently knows that supply chain issues are widespread and inflation is real, so this wont be too much of a surprise for the market. Keep in mind were still in the transitory period where the Fed is not inclined to budge of easy money policies.

In positive news, there are signs that the wave of coronavirus Delta variant cases in the US may be cresting. The seven-day average of daily Covid cases is about 144,300 as of Sept. 12, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. That figure is down 12% over the past week and 14% from the most recent peak in case counts on Sept. 1, when the country was reporting an average of roughly 167,600 cases per day. Dr. Arturo Casadevall, Chair of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology at Johns Hopkins University said, This is good news. It could represent that we have reached a peak and we are now on the way down.  As of Sept 12, 54.4% of the US population is fully vaccinated while 63.8% have received at least one dose of either Pfizer (PFE) or Moderna (MRNA). 

Shares of Chinese companies were broadly lower again as the regulatory crackdown by the CCP continues. According to a report by the Financial Times, the CCP intends to break up Alipay, the financial super-app owned by Jack Mas Ant Group that has more than $1 billion users, and force the creation of a new entity for the companys lending unit. The plan will also see Ant turn over user data that underpins its data decision to a new credit scoring joint-venture which will be partly state-owned.[ https://www.ft.com/content/01b7c7ca-71ad-4baa-bddf-a4d5e65c5d79](https://www.ft.com/content/01b7c7ca-71ad-4baa-bddf-a4d5e65c5d79)

Looking ahead, market participants are closely eyeing new reports on inflation and consumer spending set to be released next week. The former will be monitored to signal whether upward price pressures during the recovery have extended further and whether the Federal Reserve may need to step in sooner rather than later to stave off a lasting jump in inflation. Consensus economists expect Tuesday's consumer price index (CPI) to rise by 5.3% in August over last year, pulling back from July's more than a decade-high annual rise of 5.4%. 

The new data on August retail sales out from the Commerce Department later this week will also offer a look at how consumer spending has held up amid concerns over the Delta variant and rising prices. Overall retail sales are expected to drop by 0.8% in August in Thursday's report, extending July's 1.1% decline. As a reminder, consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP. 

**Highlights**

* House Democrats released details of a plan that intends to help pay for the $3.5 trillion 2021 spending bill currently in consideration. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal, D-Mass., on Monday released details of plan that includes increasing the top corporate tax rate to 26.5%, up from the current rate of 21%, and restoring the top rate to 39.6% for individuals earning over $400,000 and married couples earning over $450,000. In order for the bill to pass and avoid the filibuster, Democrats are using special budget rules but need all 50 Democratic Senators and virtually all other House Democrats to agree. 
* In more news coming out of China, regulators ordered the largest internet companies to stop blocking links from rivals on their apps, another step designed to increase competition among tech companies. Authorities have made the move against blocking external links a key focus of a campaign that started in July, after receiving multiple complaints from users, an official with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said.
* Last week, a judge in California sided with Epic Games and issued Apple a permanent injunction against their App Store policies. This move opens the door for developers to offer customers third-party payment options that do not force developers to pay Apples 15-30% commission. This is massive for companies that make a lot of their revenue through the app store.
* A cyber surveillance company based in Israel has developed a tool than can break into Apple iPhones with a never-before-seen technique for at least six months, internet security watchdog group Citizen Lab said on Monday. The discovery is important because of the critical nature of the vulnerability, which affects all versions of Apple's iOS, OSX, and watchOS. Apple confirmed the vulnerability and said the issue has been fixed in todays software update. 
* ViacomCBS (VIAC) will be restructuring Paramount Pictures amid a broader management shake-up, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal. The realignment will see Paramount focus primarily on making content for sister cable and streaming networks.

Stocks traded higher today as market participants looked ahead to stimulus talks in Washington that appear to be progressing and an upcoming round of quarterly that are expected to be improved relative to earlier in the year.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) was on fire today, finishing the day 3.09%, as the rebound in big tech continues from the September lows.. The S&amp;P (SPY) finished 1.59% up and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.87%.

Prospects for further fiscal stimulus coming from Congress has been a main point of interest for traders since the CARES Act, the first round of stimulus passed in March, ran out on July 31. Though prospects for additional passage before the November election are slim, recent reports of a $1.8 trillion proposal coming from the White House and renewed talks between Treasury Secretary Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Last weeks meetings between the pair did not produce an agreement, both parties are optimistic that a deal will  be worked out. In an interview with CNN, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow offered an upbeat assessment of the negotiations, saying that the bid and offer is narrowing somewhat between the two sides. While there is a large delta between both proposals, the fact that the White House is showing a willingness to negotiate and compromise is a good sign that negotiations are going forward in good faith. 

Third-quarter earnings begin in earnest this week. A host of big banks, including JP Morgan (JPM) and Citigroup (C), will report earnings tomorrow. Big banks, which have underperformed the broader market since the March bottom, will provide valuable information into the extent of the ongoing strain to the US economy as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. 

For this earnings season, analysts expect companies to report more year-on-year declines in profits due to business difficulties arising from the pandemic. According to data collected by FactSet, consensus estimates predict a earnings per share decline of 20.5% over the last year for companies in the S&amp;P 500. This earnings season comes at a very interesting time, with the market primed for several market-moving events, including the possibility of vaccine and therapeutic breakthroughs to treat coronavirus and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming presidential election. According to analysts at Goldman Sachs (GS), New information on the election, vaccines, and upcoming 3Q earnings represent substantial cross-currents for equities during the next two months. However, the vaccine represents a more important factor than the election result for the recovery in S&amp;P 500 fundamentals. In short, the progress of the US economy depends more on developments surrounding the disease rather than political elections or candidate differences in restoring the broken fundamentals of the stock market. 

**Highlights**

* The Bank of England has asked commercial banks whether they are ready for negative interest rates, signaling that the central bank is moving closer to cutting its key interest rate below zero. If the benchmark rate were cut to less than zero, from the current 0.1%, commercial banks would have to pay the Bank of England to hold deposits for them. Policy makers have previously indicated that they were willing to consider negative interest rates amid the economic pressures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

After a spurt in volatility last Thursday, stocks have shaken off any jitteriness, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) once again powering to fresh intraday records today. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for Q2 earnings season to begin tomorrow, with two of the largest banks in the US, JP Morgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), reporting results and Jerome Powells testimony before Congress later this week.

With Q2 earnings are fast approaching, market participants are gearing up for what is expected to be a repeat of Q1 record-setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data  an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher."" This would represent a sharp acceleration from the 50% year-on-year growth recorded during Q1s earnings season.

A big part of the strong Q2 earnings growth is easy comparisons to the year-earlier period that represented the bottom of the Covid-19 earnings impact. But Q2 estimates also reflect genuine growth, with total index earnings expected to be up +8.8% compared to the pre-Covid 2019 Q2 period. In other words, even when compared to an earnings season 2 years ago, well before the coronavirus pandemic, this earnings season is expected to show very strong growth. Estimates for Q2 and beyond have been steadily going up, with the current +60.5% earnings growth rate up from +50.6% at the end of March and +41.6% at the start of January 2021.

Goldman Sachs strategist David Kosting said that market pariticpants should focus on three questions heading into this earnings season: (1) How will companies deal with rising material costs and supply chain disruptions? (2) How are companies planning to prioritize cash spending? (3) How will companies deal with policy uncertainties, especially surrounding a potential tax hike?

In addition to earnings season, market participants are also looking forward to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell giving his semi-annual Monetary Policy Report to Congress Wednesday and Thursday of this week. Analysts are expecting Powell to once again strike a dovish tone (meaning unlikely to take aggressive action against inflation and instead favor employment), given the mixed June Job Report, which saw a better than expected number of jobs added to the economy but the unemployment rate tick higher and last weeks meeting minutes which showed an increasing divide between members regarding the timeline to begin tapering quantitative easing. In my view, Powell is trying to do three things in the upcoming meeting: (1) reiterate his view that the recovery of the economy is not yet complete, (2) inflation is a result of pandemic-era disruptions, and (3) prevent a repeat of the 2013 Taper Tantrum, an unwarranted, silly, collective market-panic that triggered a spike in U.S. Treasury yields after investors learned that the Federal Reserve was slowly putting the brakes on its quantitative easing program passed during the height of the 2008-09 recession. Moving ahead, further economic reports on consumer price inflation and retail sales out this week are expected to once again underscore that the pace of economic recovery in the US remains limited by supply chain disruptions and labor market imbalances.

Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab said, I think the recovery is on track, its really just the rate of change that has slowed. We couldnt continue to grow at 9-10% GDP growth every quarter, so obviously its going to slow down. I think one of the things that got into markets that got \[Treasury\] yields tumbling was maybe the fact that the Fed was going to hike rates sooner than anticipated. That sends a signal to the long end of the bond market that maybe the Fed isn;t going to tolerate higher inflation for longer and that theyre going to step on the brakes sooner rather than later ... we don't think that's going to be the case though. We think the economy is doing well, yields will probably bounce back."" I agree with this sentiment. 

**Highlights**

* Over the weekend, Richard Branson became the first civilian to go to space with his own company Virgin Galactic (SPCE), a remarkable milestone as companies like Bezos Blue Origin and Musks SpaceX intensify competition in space tourism.
* Despite successfully completing the trip, shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) fell more than 10% after the company announced it planned to take advantage of the elevated stock price by selling $500 million in stock.
* Tesla (TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk on Monday defended the electric-vehicle maker's purchase of SolarCity Corp. in court, telling a Delaware judge that he didn't act improperly during the negotiating process. This comes in response to a lawsuit filed by TSLA shareholders that allege Musk forced the company to buy SolarCity, a solar-cell manufacturer, in order to save his investment in the company. Frankly, this lawsuit seems a little ridiculous to me given SolarCity has proven a smart acquisition.
* Walt Disney (DIS) said on Sunday that Black Widow, the newest Marvel movie, made $80 million in theater sales, the largest domestic opening weekend since Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker in 2019, a strong sign that appetite to go to the movies remains high among Americans. Comparatively, Black Widow made $60 million through streaming purchases.
* In yet another crackdown of big-tech companies, Chinese regulators are reportedly set to order Tencent (TCEHY) to give up their exclusive rights to music labels and pay a small fine.
* Broadcom (AVGO) is reportedly in talks to by SAS Institute, a software company with upwards of $3 billion a year in revenue in a deal valued between $15-$20 billion. This is yet another acquisition by one of the worlds largest semiconductor companies.
* Microsoft (MSFT) announced it was acquiring cybersecurity firm RiskIQ to help reduce risk amid the increasing sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks.

Stocks reversed from yesterdays technology-led selloff, with the Dow Jones (DIA) reaching a new intraday record high. Continuing the recent bout of volatility, the three major indexes sold off in the last few hours of the market session, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) turning negative.   Market participants continue to look towards the slew of corporate earnings, new economic data, and commentary from key monetary policymakers. 

The sharp move lower in stock yesterday came, ostensibly, after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested that interest rates may need to rise in the near-term to prevent the economy from overheating, with the recent economic data and corporate earnings showing economic activity recovering much faster than expected as effective distribution of the vaccine in the US allows states to gradually reopen. Yellen said, It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them."" In later remarks, she added that raising rates was not something she was predicting or recommending and that the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Reserve. She said, Let me be clear, thats not something Im predicting or recommending. If anybody appreciates the independence of the Fed, I think that person is me.

With the major indexes hovering near record levels for many consecutive days, equities were due for a pullback at the slightest mention of bad news. Kevin Mahm, chief investment officer at Hennion and Walsh Investment Management said, I do think there's a potential for a short-term bounce in volatility due to those excessive valuations and all of the uncertainty that currently stands with respect to the infrastructure spending bill, ultimately how its going to be funded, and certain taxation policies. But, beyond the short-term bouts of volatility, there is continued reason for optimism, whether its consumer confidence, whether its the strength in earnings, recognizing that thus far we have an 86% beat rate for the companies that have reported.

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating Marchs gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

**Highlights**

* As a reminder, the April Labor Report will be released on Friday. Will be important in gauging how the labor market is doing
* Shares of Peloton (PTON) sold off sharply after the company issued a recall of its Tread+ and Tread treadmills following a slew of accidents, including the death of a child. A few weeks ago, John Foley, CEO of Peloton, resisted calls from the US Consumer Product Safety, something he called a mistake. He said, Peloton made a mistake in our initial response to the Consumer Product Safety Commissions request that we recall the Tread+. We should have engaged more productively with them from the outset. For that, I apologize.
* Tomorrow, May 6, EV maker NIO will hold a news conference where the company is expected to talk about its plans to expand to the European markets.
* Virgin Galactic (SPCE) shares drop after Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos space company, announced plans for first New Shepard suborbital flight in July of this year. Virgin Galactic plans to reopen ticket sales after the founder makes his own first flight, now slated for the summer after several delays.
* The U.S. Commerce Department is pressing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) and other Taiwanese firms to prioritise the needs of U.S. automakers to ease chip shortages in the near term, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said.
* Factory orders rose 1.1% in March over February after a 0.5% drop the month prior, according to the Department of Commerce. This was still slightly short of 1.3% estimates.

Stocks traded mixed on Tuesday, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) gaining while the Dow Jones (DIA) fell modestly. Market participants are closely monitoring the pace of vaccine distribution after US federal health officials called for the pause in the rollout of the Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine and the upcoming earnings season.

In a joint statement posted to Twitter [(check out the thread here](https://twitter.com/US_FDA/status/1381925612743499778)), The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) called for a pause in the rollout of the JNJ vaccine following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered.

In a statement, JNJ said it has been working closely with medical experts and health authorities, and we strongly support the open communication of this information to healthcare professionals and the public and added In addition, we have been reviewing these cases with European health authorities. We have made the decision to proactively delay the rollout of our vaccine in Europe. During a press briefing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the J&amp;J vaccine review would likely take days to weeks, rather than weeks to months, in order to resolve.

As earnings season kicks off, a slew of recent promising economic data has suggested corporate profits will jump in tandem with the recovering economy, especially in the sectors most heavily affected by the pandemic. Over the past several weeks, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by record levels with the expectation that recent economic growth will drive corporate earnings higher. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 1, 2021**

The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) continued their remarkable rally to once again reach new intraday record highs, with equities carrying on momentum from a record-setting October. Market participants continue to be encouraged by the stronger-than-expected start of the Q3 corporate earnings season, with companies posting robust results despite ongoing supply-side disruptions and labor market imbalances. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for the Feds monthly meeting minutes, set to be released later this week, where I expect the Fed to officially start the tapering process, and the October jobs report, which is expected to show a pick-up in hiring after two disappointing months in a row.

According to a report by LPL Financial, November has been the best month for equities since 1950.

Though some of the heavily weighted index components from last week had disappointed against consensus estimates  with both Amazon and Apple shares dropping after posting weaker-than-expected results and guidance  other stronger results helped offset these misses, with names including Alphabet and Microsoft rallying to record levels on the heels of their respective reports. 

On Tuesday and Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will meet for its monthly policy-setting meeting, which is followed by a statement and press conference by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. This meeting is expected to either announce or concretely set the stage to being tapering the pace of quantitative easing which has been running at a clip of $120 billion per month. Last month, the Fed announced that amid improving economic data, the process would begin before the end of the year and would come to an end around mid-2022. 

Given the market has been anticipating the start to tapering for months now, speculation around when the Fed will make a move on interest rates has become a point of particular interest to investors. This week's FOMC statement and press conference are likely to provide some more color to market participants around how committee members are thinking about the timing for interest-rate hikes, especially given the persistent jump in inflation seen in data including last week's core personal consumption expenditures report.

**Highlights**

* Tesla (TSLA) continued its psycho-rally to reach a new all time high and making CEO Elon Musk the first person ever to surpass a $300 billion personal net worth. Absolutely insane.
* Amazon (AMZN) seeks approval from the Federal Communications Commission to launch two Project Kuiper satellites in 2022. Similar to SpaceX, it intends to be a broad constellation of internet and broadband satellites.
* Peloton (PTON) and Delta Airlines (DAL) partnered together to make exclusive meditation and stretching content for Deltas in-seat screens. Delta stock rallied more than 3% on the news while PTON traded 1.5% higher
* Shares of education company Chegg (CHGG) gapped down more than 25% after posting disappointing earnings.ims for $53 billion valuation in upcoming IPO.
* EV startup Rivian which is backed by Amazon (AMZN) and Ford Motors (F) is reportedly seeking a $53 billion valuation for its upcoming IPO

Also assume that one already has other plays like value, oil, etc.  e.g. I am not asking if these stocks are overpriced and if we should instead buy CVX or HAL, etc.

NVDA has AI, which appears to still be at an early stage and has unrealized potential.  However, it is unclear how much of that potential is real and how much is hype.  If we get a bear market, NVDA will drop but might come back once the AI potential is realized, especially if the AI is needed for the event triggering the bear market (e.g. making smart weapons to combat Russia, accelerating green technologies to combat climate change, etc.).

GOOGL also has AI and some other plays like Waymo, but GOOGL remains mostly advertising.  If we do get a recession or a bear market, GOOGL could get hit hard and might also be slower to recover.

MSFT seems the most stable of the three, but I'm not sure if the growth will be as high going forward.  Seems like most businesses already use Office and while MSFT could raise the price, there does not appear to be as much expansion in terms of brand new accounts.

Stocks traded mixed on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones rallying to intraday highs while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back. Market participants digested a slew of corporate earnings reports from big banks in the US and remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell

Earnings kicked off this morning with several banks reporting first-quarter earnings. JPMorgan (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) blew past analyst expectations, driven by lower loan losses, robust trading and investment banking revenue. Expectations for a strong profit rebound have helped financial stocks and the equity markets rally but have also set a high bar for companies to clear. 

Wall Street analysts are expecting a surge in corporate profits in tandem with the recovering economy, with the reopening of the economy and a rise in consumer spending set to boost companies results. Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial said, We could see upwards of 30% year-over-year earnings growth in the first quarter. That would be the most weve seen since coming out of the financial crisis. Expectations are for about 25% earnings growth in the first quarter. And lets not forget in the previous two quarters what happened: massive, massive beats.

Jerome Powell reiterated that a near-term move on interest rates remains unlikely until economic recovery, and particularly the labor market, are able to build up momentum and said the Central Bank would slow the pace of its bond purchase program well before raising interest rates. Powell said, We will taper asset purchases when weve made substantial further progress toward our goals from last December when we announced that guidance. That would in all likelihood be well before the time we consider raising rates.

Looking ahead, market participants will closely monitor the report of March retail sales set to be released tomorrow. March retail sales are expected to be strong, with stimulus checks making their way into the economy and the economy gradually reopening due to effective distribution of the vaccine. Economists expect March retail sales to rise a consensus 6.1%, or 5.3% excluding autos, according to Dow Jones. That compares to a sales decline of 3% in February

**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, August 24, 2021**

Stocks continued their strong performance, recovering from jitteriness last week to reach new intraday record highs in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ). The Dow Jones (DIA) traded modestly even and remains roughly $2 from its record high. The Russell 2000 (IWM) which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued rallying after steeply underperforming last week, climbing roughly 3% in the last two days. After an initial shock following the release of the Federal Reserves July meeting minutes, it seems fears over the taper timeline have receded for the moment. As I have been saying, I remain unfazed by any talk about a potential taper timeline. On a personal note, I remain bullish until discussion about an interest rate hike begins, and will reconsider my position then. Looking ahead, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to give his annual Jackson Hole speech on Thursday.

This earnings season has been a smashing, record-breaking success. 91% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 87% of those outperforming estimates in revenue. The blended, year-over-year earnings growth rate is an eye-popping 85.1%, absolutely smashing original estimates of 66.5%. What is most remarkable is this comes among a resurgence of coronavirus cases due to the delta variant, supply-side disruptions, and labor market imbalances in the US. 

Keith Lerner, Chief Market Strategist at Truist Financial, gave this take about earnings, We think the primary trend is higher. Were only about one year into this economic expansion. Expansions typically last about five years, And the earnings season which we just got out of was phenomenal. Even if its peak growth, we still think its going to be strong growth. You have earnings moving forward and then you look at the relative comparison of stocks relative to bonds and theyre still attractive. Overall, we think the right position is to be overweight stocks.

US Crude oil prices gained for a second straight session, building on advances after recently hitting a seven-day consecutive losing streak. West Texas intermediate crude oil rose by nearly 3% on Tuesday to settle at $67.54 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, also gained to top $71 per barrel.

Energy prices gained as optimism mounted over a pick-up in consumer mobility following the full FDA approval of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine. U.S. crude oil prices have so far risen 39% for the year-to-date.

* Shares of Airbnb (ABNB) gapped up more than 8% amid this broader rebound by travel and leisure stocks

New home sales increased 1.0% in July compared to June, bringing sales to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 708,000. Consensus economists were looking for a rate of 697,000 homes. Sales in June were also upwardly revised to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 701,000, from the 676,000 previously reported.

Stocks finished mixed today in a choppy session, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) recovering some losses after yesterdays session, closing 0.17% and 0.47% higher respectively. On the other hand, the Dow Jones (DIA) fell modestly, closing 0.18% down while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued underperforming, closing 1.21% down today and almost 5% down this week. Market participants continue to digest the implication of the Federal Reserves July Meeting Minutes, which showed there are increasing discussions surrounding a potential taper timeline, with members suggesting they could begin this year if the current pace of economic recovery continues.  The most important thing is the Fed re-committed to maintaining the interest rate near-zero until at least 2023. That will be the real test for equities in my opinion. 

Yesterdays meeting minutes suggested members of the Federal Reserve were advancing the debate over the timing and scope of tapering the pace of the pandemic-era asset purchasing program. In the latest minutes, the Fed said, looking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as anticipated, they judged it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year.As I said above, this makes a lot of sense judging how the economy has also so far rebounded at a faster pace than expected. Given this record-breaking quarter in terms of corporate earnings and improving labor market conditions, the economy is beginning to be able to stand on its own without all the pandemic-era support. However, while progress has been made, the Feds goal has not yet been reached. The meeting minutes said,  most participants judged that the Committees standard of substantial further progress toward the maximum-employment goal had not yet been met. 

Today, the Labor Department released their Weekly Unemployment Report, which, along with other recent reports, vindicates the Feds assessment that the labor market has substantially recovered from heights of the pandemic-induced recession. Initial Unemployment claims came in at 348,000, the lowest level since March 2020 and better than the 364,000 expected and 377,000 the previous week. Continuing claims came in at 2.82 million, roughly in line with the 2.8 million expected

In order to stave off another taper tantrum and directly address interest rates concerns, the minutes explicitly stressed the need to reaffirm the absence of any mechanical link between the timing of tapering and that of an eventual increase in the target range for the federal funds rate. Participants voted to maintain the interest rate near zero. I cannot stress this enough, potential interest rate hikes in 2023 will be the real test for equities. Until then I remain very bullish and will continue buying up every dip (has worked wonderfully so far). Of this, the meeting minutes said, A couple of participants also noted that a tapering of asset purchases did not amount to a tightening of the stance of monetary policy and instead only implied that additional monetary accommodation would be provided at a slower rate.

On inflation, the minutes said With regard to inflation, participants commented that recent inflation readings had been boosted by the effects of supply bottlenecks and labor shortages and were likely to be transitory and Some other participants emphasized that recent high inflation readings had largely been driven by price increases in a handful of categories. These participants pointed out that there was no evidence of broad-based price pressures or of inappropriately high longer-term inflation expectations. Several participants also commented that price increases concentrated in a small number of categories were unlikely to change underlying inflation dynamics sufficiently to overcome the possibility of a persistent downward bias in inflation, as might be associated with the effective lower bound. However, other participants, like St. Louis President James Bullard, raised concerns about recent inflationary readings and the need for the Federal Reserve to be ready and able to act if current circumstances change.

In short, the meeting minutes showed there was some divide in opinion among members, with the only thing unanimously agreed on was that interest rates will remain near-zero for the foreseeable future. One quote I think highlights the minutes well is this one, A few participants expressed concerns that maintaining highly accommodative financial conditions might contribute to a further buildup in risk to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committees dual-mandate goals. In contrast, a few other participants suggested that preparations for reducing the pace of asset purchases should encompass the possibility that the reductions might not occur for some time and highlighted the risks that rising COVID-19 cases associated with the spread of the Delta variant could cause delays in returning to work and school and so damp the economic recovery.

I recommend everyone read the full meeting minutes, it's really not that long and super insightful: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf)

**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, December 23, 2021**

The stock market continued its positive momentum, with all three major indexes pushing higher for the third straight day to close out the holiday-shortened week as investors continue to digest a trove of new economic data, including a report on inflation, and the FDA approval of Pfizer (PFE) and Mercks (MRK) coronavirus anti-viral pill. 

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +0.61%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): +0.75%
* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.55%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +0.81%
* Volatility Index (VIX): -5.15%
* Tesla (TSLA): +5.81%
* Crocs (CROX): -11.93%

Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) rose 5.7% in November, the fastest pace in over three decades. PCE price index rose 0.6% for the month, slightly lower than the 0.7% monthly gain in October. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 4.7%

Personal incomes rose 0.4% in November, slightly lower than a 0.5% increase in October. That followed a 1% plunge in September, when federal unemployment benefit expansion came to an end. 

Consumer spending, which accounts for 70% of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.6% in November, a solid gain but below the 1.4% surge in October.

Kathy Bostjanic, Chief US Financial Economist at Oxford Economics. said Consumers spent with less enthusiasm in November as they shifted their holiday shopping to earlier in the season and continued to contend with escalating prices and reduced product availability.

While the consumer price index (CPI) is the better known price gauge, the Federal Reserve prefers to follow the Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures price index in setting its interest-rate policies to fight inflation. The PCE price index tracks the actual purchases consumers are making each month while the CPI follows a fixed market basket of goods.

The Labor Departments Weekly Unemployment Report showed that initial jobless claims last week totaled 205,000. The latest print brings the four-week moving average for new claims to its lowest in 52 years, reflecting a very tight labor market. 

Merck (MRK) received authorization from the FDA for its anti-viral coronavirus pill, the second at-home treatment approved in the US. This follows Pfizer, who received approval for their COVID pill yesterday. 

The pill developed by Merck in conjunction with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, called molnupiravir, was shown to reduce hospitalizations and deaths by around 30% in clinical trial data. Pfizer's pill was reported to be 90% effective at preventing hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients.

On Wednesday, the latest estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, third-quarter U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) was revised higher. Analysts now expect GDP to show a 2.3% annualized increase in economic activity in Q3, up from the 2.1% rise previously estimated. 

Moreover, the Conference Boards highly anticipated Consumer Confidence Index report showed a greater than expected increase in December. The institution's headline index crept higher to 115.8 in December, based on the latest release. This was above the 111.0 expected, according to Bloomberg consensus data.

**Highlights**

* November sales of new U.S. homes jumped 12.4% to a seven-month high. The Census Bureau reported that new home sales rose 82,000 last month from October to 744,000, buoyed by low mortgage rates and higher demand in the housing industry.
* U.S. durable goods orders rose by 2.5% in November, up from the prior month, boosted by a sharp rise in aircraft orders.
* Core capital goods orders, a measure of business investment in equipment that excludes aircraft and military hardware, fell 0.1% after an upwardly revised 0.9% increase in October
* Electric carmaker Tesla Inc will stop allowing video games to be played on its infotainment systems while its vehicles are moving, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said on Thursday.
* Meta (FB) appealed the UKs ruling that it must sell moving-image company Giphy.
* fourth-quarter sales in the U.S. are expected to jump 42.8% to 97,417 electric vehicles from a year ago and 28.8% over the previous quarter, the latest automotive industry forecast from auto information company TrueCar.
* TikTok was the most visited website in the entire internet in 2021, beating out Google.
* Nio announced that it received the U.N. certification on cybersecurity management, which is a major global mandatory regulation with regards to cybersecurity. It is widely applicable in countries such as the EU, the U.K., Japan and South Korea.

The market edged higher once again, with both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) driven higher by an incredible rally in technology stocks. The Dow Jones (DIA), which suffered its worst performance since October 2020 last week continued to recover, pushed higher by a rally in bank and industrial stocks. Reopening stocks like cruise lines, hotels, and airlines continue to underperform the market, pressured by the rotation back to growth and concerns that inflation will drive prices in this sector higher. 

After driving the market higher in the beginning of the year, the last two or so months have seen the market firmly rotate from value and cyclical stocks back to growth and technology stocks due to recent inflationary numbers and labor market disruption that threaten to drive prices for services in this sector higher. However, as I have said previously, while I acknowledge the risk, I am not yet concerned that current inflation will become a persistent threat, at least in the near-term. While that may change and I advise people to be ready in case the Fed is forced to tighten rates sooner-than-expected, I expect value and cyclicals to continue recovering as the US economy continues to reopen. With the stock markets great performance in the last 12-14 months and government coronavirus stimulus, I expect savings-laden consumers to spend big this summer after being cooped up indoors for so long. 

Keith Lerner, Portfolio and Market Strategist at Truist Securities said, The value trade is still intact. It got overcrowded, it got over-loved ... but when we look at the fundamental drivers behind that trade, they're still intact. So the first thing is, context. Yes, they had a big run this year, but they've trailed for about 14 years, so we've had a long underperformance cycle,"" he added. ""And the second part is, why did they underperform for so long is because we had really slow economic growth. And this year and next we expect above-trend economic growth. And the earnings momentum and the earnings leverage for these areas is still positive."" 

Later today, the Fed is set to release the results of its stress test on the US largest banks, an annual test meant to test the financial health of lenders that was instituted following the 2009 financial crisis. The tests are designed to see how banks would fare during a hypothetical extreme economic downturn (not unlike what banks experienced last year). This stress test is extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Thanks to those measures, plus low interest rates and government stimulus that held off loan losses, analysts expect banks to perform well on Thursday, which would lead the Fed to lift remaining capital distribution curbs, opening the floodgates for banks to increase dividends and reinstitute stock buy back programs. **If these restrictions are fully lifted, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters. This is huge if it happens.** 

On Friday, Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting ""base effects"" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the board

**Highlights**

* **As I was finishing the recap the news is out, the Fed is ending pandemic-era restriction on banks in stock buybacks and dividend increases. This is great news for banks.** More information here [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/fed-bank-stress-tests.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/fed-bank-stress-tests.html)
* After being under pressure in recent months, shares of Tesla (TSLA) have begun rallying again, with the stock up more than 10% this week alone. 
* Today, Microsoft will unveil the long-awaited sequel to Windows 10. Windows 11, the product's first new version in almost six years, includes only limited changes to its visual design, but it seeks to reposition the operating system as a hub in a computing universe incorporating rival companies' platforms, including Android mobile software developed by Google and a digital storefront developed by Amazon (AMZN).[ Read more here ](https://www.cnet.com/news/microsofts-windows-11-reveal-event-every-upgrade-announced/)
* The House Judiciary Committee voted on Thursday to approve the final piece of its six-part package, the ""Ending Platform Monopolies Act,"" which restricts big tech companies' ability to leverage their platform dominance to promote other lines of business and disadvantage competitors. The vote on the bill was 21-20. The bill will now move on to the House floor and, if passed there, the Senate. The bill is newsworthy but pretty much doomed to fail.
* Snapchat (SNAP) users globally will get access to Universal Music Group's library of recorded music and content for their own content-making on the social media platform, the companies said Thursday. This move comes as US social media companies across the board continue to implement more TikTok-like features. To show just how much TikTok has grown, parent company ByteDancehas a market cap of roughly $250 billion, almost $100 billion more than Snap and Twitter (TWTR) combined. 
* **Cathie Wood** and Twitter and Square (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey have been named as co-hosts of The ¿ Word, a new initiative designed to bring business and technology leaders together to discuss how institutions can use digital currencies.

Choppiness in the market continued, with stocks closing the day mixed, with the tech- heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) falling while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) powered to new, intraday record highs, driven by strength in financial and industrial stocks. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-cap stocks, traded mostly even, closing the day 0.22% higher. Like I have been saying for weeks now, while I remain bullish I expect a lot of choppiness in the market moving forward. In my view, there are a variety of contending factors affecting the market, including but not limited to: (1) record corporate earnings, (2) Senates passage of the infrastructure bill, (3) improving labor market, (4) rising concerns surrounding the delta variant, (5) concerns around inflation, (6) regulatory concerns in China.

Today, the price of oil rebounded from a three week low, with the market hoping that the resilient demand from the West may offset weak demand from China. Yesterday, oil prices tumbled due to concerns that the latest outbreak of COVID in China would trigger a swift response from the government, which has been so far extremely aggressive in battling the virus. Chinas National Health Commission said it confirmed 146 new infections as of Monday - the fourth straight day it reported 90 cases and above and the second day it has reported over 100 cases. Of the newly confirmed cases, 71 were locally transmitted, said the health commission. 

While those numbers are very small compared to the US, it is important to note that the Chinese government has a so-called zero-COVID approach, meaning the government is sure to act very aggressively, much more than is possible in Western countries, to stamp out the virus. Already, the CCP has ordered mass testing in areas of high transmission, re-implemented extensive lockdowns, enacted new travel restrictions within the country, and extended the closure of its borders to foreign travelers. As of yesterday, at least 47 officials have been punished for negligence, according to state reports. 

Shockingly, we actually have some good news coming out of Congress. The US Senate gave surprisingly bipartisan approval to a $1 trillion infrastructure bill. The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nations roads and bridges, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nations broadband infrastrucutre. The vote, 69-30, was uncommonly bipartisan given the seeming contention the Republicans had for the initial drafts of the infrastructure bill. 

**Highlights**

* The 2020 Olympics concluded and were a wild disappointment, with ratings experiencing a 42% decline compared to the 2016 Olympics. 
* Wild ride in AMC today. Shares gapped up more than 10% premarket before falling throughout the session to close the day -6% down, a 16% intraday swing. 
* According to a new report by the Department of Labor, worker productivity grew at a slower-than-expected pace in Q2. Nonfarm productivity grew at a 2.3% annualized rate, down from 4.3% pace in Q1
* Pepsi (PEP) partnered with Boston Beer (SAM) to produce an alcoholic rendition of the popular soda Mountain Dew. Product expected to be on the shelves by early 2022
* DraftKings (DKNG) announced a content partnership with Autograph, an NFT company founded by NFL superstar Tom Brady. Matt Kalish, DKNG President said, Autographs Advisory Board includes some of the most iconic athletes ever and we could not imagine a more fitting figure than Tom Brady to headline our first ever NFT drop on DraftKings Marketplace. A lot of activity has been coming from DKNG recently. 
* Tesla sold 32,968 China-made cars, including those for export, according tyo the China Passenger Car Association. 
* Upstart (UPST), one of my fav fin-tech stocks that Ive been holding for a while popped off after earnings, up more than 15%. Im very happy about that :)
* Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy said he is trying to build the most forward-thinking sports gambling company. This comes on the backs of Penns (who owns 36% of Barstool) acquired Score Media, the leading sports content app in Canada and third largest in the US. I think this is a very interesting partnership between all companies.

Stocks traded mostly sideways today to end the day slightly negative as investors weighed disappointing news on the stimulus front, a challenging reopening with some places being forced to go back on partial quarantine measures, and a US election which is now less than 3 weeks away.

For the day the SPY was down 0.07%, the QQQ down 0.57%, and the DIA incredibly up 0.37%. This price action, hints to a rotation out of the high flying names and into the reopening of the economy and more industrial names.

On the COVID front, this week was difficult as cases in the US have topped 8 Million. Furthermore, two of the vaccine frontrunners, Johnson and Johnson and Eli Lilly halted their trials due to safety and quality concerns. Also the CEO of Pfizer today stated that the company would not apply for emergency use authorization of its vaccine any earlier than the third week of November.

The United States Budget Deficit has increased to a record $3.1Trillion in fiscal year 2020. In comparison to last year's, it has tripled in size, mostly due to the measures put in place in response to the COVID pandemic. As a share of GDP this represents 16%, the largest since WWII, to put this into context in the 2009 crisis it reached almost 10% at its peak. The biggest chunk of spending came as federal spending jumped 47% due to increased unemployment compensation needs. Still Fed Chair Jerome Powell as soon as last week kept warning that recovery will be fragile and more so without additional aid from Congress and added that providing too much stimulus shouldnt be a problem, according to a report by Bloomberg.

The figures for retail sales for the month of September have been reported today and they show that US retail sales have grown for the 5th month in a row driven by strong spending in clothing, cars and sporting goods, according to a report published by MarketBeat. Sales jumped 1.9% which is more than double of the consensus estimate. Americans raced to the stores in September, said BMO Capital Markets analyst Sal Guatieri, in a note to investors, adding that they were buying just about everything in sight, especially clothing.

In Europe things have been shaky as the U.K. faces resurgence in COVID cases, and a bumpy BREXIT negotiation. Partial quarantine measures have been put back in place, and negotiations between the U.K. and European Union will continue next week. Boris Johnson has told Bloomberg that he believes a deal is unlikely.

Highlights

* A new plan was unveiled today to get COVID shots to nursing homes, even though such a vaccine does not yet exist. This led to skepticism from experts. Under the program, trained staff from CVS (CVS) and Walgreens (WBA) would deliver the vaccines and administer the shots.

Stocks rose once again, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) both recording new intraday highs amid the continued push by technology stocks. The Dow Jones (DIA) rose as well, but continued to lag behind the other two indexes. Market participants are encouraged by the June Jobs Report, which showed payroll gains rise more than expected. 

Today, the US Department of Labor released the Job June report, which showed a stronger-than-expected acceleration in hiring, with non-farm payrolls rising by 850,000, the sixth straight month of gains. The unemployment rate however, ticked slightly higher to 5.9%. Here are the numbers

* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** 850,000 vs. 720,000 expected and an upwardly revised 583,000 in May
* **Unemployment rate:** 5.9% vs. 5.6% expected and 5.8% in May 
* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.3% vs. 0.3% expected and a downwardly revised 0.4% in May
* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 3.6% vs. 3.6% expected and a downwardly revised 1.9% in May

President Biden said of the report, This is historic progress, pulling our economy out of the worst crisis in 100 years, driven in part by our dramatic progress in vaccinating our nation and beating back the pandemic. Today, the US is the only major advanced economy where the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) projections of future output are higher today than they were in January 2020 before the pandemic hit.

Emily Roland, co-Chief Investment Strategist at John Hancock Investment Management said of the report, This is the Goldilocks Report that the market was looking for today. You had a nice print here of 850,000 jobs being added, wage pressure remaining  I wouldn't call them necessarily contained  but surprising here on the downside versus consensus estimates. So this is telling us right now that economic growth is continuing to accelerate here, the jobs market is continuing to heal. We're making progress here in terms of what the Fed has set out to do, which is in order to get unemployment down, they're going to let inflation run a little bit hot here. Not too hot, not too cold  this is just what the market wants.""

This Job Report will give market participants a better idea as to the timing of the Federal Reserves next monetary policy. For now, the Fed has so far kept in place both of its key pandemic-era policies - quantitative easing at a clip of $120 billion a month and near-zero interest rates. However, the Fed has consistently said they are looking for a string of strong jobs reports, like the one this month before any adjustments to the current policy is made. If the Jobs Report continues being especially strong in the months ahead, it could force the Fed to taper quantitative easing earlier than originally telegraphed. I have said  before in the past I expect the Fed to begin tapering QE towards the end of the year and am not worried about that at all. For starters, the market has historically reacted very little to changes in QE ([see the 2013 Taper Tantrum here)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp), its changes in the interest rate that really drive the market, and second, the Fed is expected to taper slowly, making any changes gradual.

**Highlights**

* Shares of AMC pulled back slightly after financial firm Iceberg Research announced they have opened a short position. Honestly, I have no idea why they did this, only opening themselves up to becoming WSB's next target. Will be interesting to see what happens moving forward.
* More bad news for Lordstown Motors, who have already been the subject of a short report that saw the company admit they had inflated the importance of preorders for the electric pickup truck and forced the CEO to leave. Now, the Justice Department has announced it is opening a probe into the company to investigate comments made by executives and the way the company represented its pre orders to shareholders.

The stock market pulled a remarkable turnaround today, shaking off yesterdays declines with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) rocketing to another record intraday high, led by the financial and energy sectors, which had been lagging as of late and continued strength in mega-cap tech stocks. It seems that after a brief flare-up of concerns regarding the coronavirus delta variant and a potential acceleration of the timeline to taper quantitative easing in the US, fears have greatly tempered. At the time of writing, the Dow Jones (DIA) rose 1.27% while the Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 0.6% and is very slightly below its all-time high. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, led the day, rising more than 2%.

In recent weeks, market participants are increasingly trying to gauge if the surge we are seeing in the more contagious coronavirus delta variant will weigh on global growth rates. Yesterday, it seems concerns came to a head after the Japanese government made a last minute announcement that a state of emergency would be re-instituted across Tokyo and that all events would take place behind closed doors, with no spectators, walking back an earlier decision to allow locals to attend the games. The state of emergency will begin on Monday and run through Aug. 22, while the games are scheduled from July 23 to Aug. 8. On Wednesday, 16 days before the Opening Ceremony, the [Tokyo Metropolitan Government reported 920 COVID cases](https://stopcovid19.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/en), over 200 more than any other single-day total since May. On Thursday, it reported 896, the second-highest count since May. Other countries, like India and Brazil, are also dealing with an extremely worrying surge of cases. Even in the US, where roughly 50% of those eligible are fully vaccinated, the country is seeing a small surge in cases recently, with the delta variant accounting for 51.7% of all new infections, according to the CDC. According to reports, as of yesterday, only 16.8% of the Japanese population was vaccinated against the virus. 

In other news, in another move that raised concerns about the global growth rate, Chinas central bank signalled it will be cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, a move that suggests the economic recovery in China may be slowing down. The Peoples Bank of China (PBOC) will reduce the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage points for most banks, according to a [statement](http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/4287599/index.html) published Friday. That will unleash about 1 trillion yuan ($154 billion) of long-term liquidity into the economy and will be effective on July 15, the central bank said. The reduction was signaled earlier this week, when the State Council, Chinas equivalent of a cabinet, hinted the central bank would make more liquidity available to banks so they could lend to smaller firms hurt by rising costs. The timing and magnitude of the move, coming a week before second-quarter growth data, suggests worries about the economys outlook and was a decisive shift away from policy tightening, which most, if not all, recovering economies are pursuing.

Ken Cheung, Chief Asian Foreign Exchange Strategist at Mizuho, said The PBOC came in broader and sooner than expected, highlighting the policy urgency to support the Chinese economy. Such firm easing measures could further fuel concern over Chinas growth outlook in the second half as well as the upcoming Q2 GDP figures in the coming week. Just to put into more familiar terms, this would be like if the Federal Reserve suddenly turned around and said rather than discussing tapering quantitative easing, it would instead propose pumping more money into the economy.

While these global concerns did jitter the market yesterday, the impressive recovery in US equities underscores the remarkable strength of its economy, as the country continues reopening thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, with 48% of the population fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. In my opinion, while the delta variant does pose a risk to global growth rates, and the market may react negatively to headlines about it, the foundations of the recovery in the US (i.e nation-wide reopening measures, a rapidly improving labor market, record earnings from companies, and a high level of savings among Americans) are very strong and will continue to underpin a bull market here. 

**Highlights** 

* The recent sell-off in crude oil recovered, with the West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settling higher by 2.2% to $74.56 per barrel at the time of writing.
* Apple (AAPL), the largest company in the world, reached a new all-time high today. 
* President Biden is expected to sign an executive agreement ordering the Federal Trade Commission to limit or ban noncompete agreements, unnecessary occupational licenses, and revise guidance for sharing wage information between the HR department and workers and other employers. 
* Tesla (TSLA), Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) said Friday they would work together on a new initiative to create the nation's most sustainable residential community. The companies said the provisionally named SunHouse at Easton Park in Austin, Texas, would be the first Tesla Solar neighborhood.
* On Monday, a trial will kick off in the Court of Chancery in Wilmington, Delaware between Elon Musk and shareholders. The plaintiffs alleged that Musk used his control at Tesla to force the company to buy SolarCity for $2.6 billion in order to protect his investment in the company from bankruptcy and want Musk to pay that money back to Tesla. IMO seems a little weird to me to sue about this given that SolarCity has proven to be a good acquisition for Tesla.
* Apple (AAPL) is reportedly in early talks with the NFL to buy the rights to stream Sunday Night games for their streaming service. A while ago, Amazon (AMZN) bought the right to stream Thursday NFL games for Prime Video. 
* Marvels Black Widow, opened in theaters last night and is expected to be the biggest opening since 2019, with the film projected to bring around $80 million domestically. This is huge and a sign that Americans' appetite to go to movie-theaters is very real. Personally, Im going to go watch in the theaters this weekend. 
* Foxconn, a well known supplier for Apple, is discussing plans with Fisker (FSR) to open a factory to build EVs in Wisconsin. In a statement, the company said, Foxconn has engaged the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) to discuss the company's plans for electric vehicle manufacturing.

Stocks opened deep in the red Friday but managed to recover some throughout the session. Pres. Trumps announcement that he had tested positive for the coronavirus injected further uncertainty into an already volatile environment, concerned with the pandemic and the upcoming presidential election.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) underperformed heavily, finishing the day 2.81% down. The S&amp;P (SPY) finished the day 0.94% down, and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.5%

Last night, President Trump announced that he and the First lady tested positive for the coronavirus. This comes shortly after it was reported that Hope Hicks, senior counselor to Pres. Trump tested positive. Joe Biden announced that he was negative after spending time with Trump during the debate. Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com said, Word that the president and first lady have tested positive for COVID-19 marks the addition of further uncertainty when it was already abundant, typically toxic for financial markets. We were already expecting that with the approach of Election Day. No doubt this may exacerbate that risk amid no shortage of other sources of uncertainty and volatility."" The White House has canceled all of Trumps previously scheduled public events, which included a rally in Florida on Friday.

Yesterday night, House Democrats voted to advance their new $2.2 trillion stimulus package, although it is almost certainly going to be struck down in the Republican-controlled Senate, who are rumored to have a ceiling at $1-1.5 trillion.

Today, the Labor Department reported that 661,000 jobs were added in the month of September, far below Wall Streets expectation, suggesting that the labor market recovery from the coronavirus pandemic is slowing amid fading government support, political uncertainty, and rising infections in the US and Europe. Economists surveyed by Refinitiv, a well-respected provider of global financial markets data, estimated that 850,000 jobs would be added. This is the last monthly job report before the November election. Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of Global Fixed Income, said The economy is still recovering and still seeing month-to-month pockets of improvement, but clearly the rate of employment recovery will be uneven from here. The fact remains that there continues to be great uncertainty regarding the progression of the coronavirus pandemic and the timing of a return to economic normalcy, and nowhere is that more apparent than in the labor market.

**Highlights**

* NIO  despite delivering more vehicles than expected in the third quarter, because investors may have bought the rumor and sold the news. 
* Tesla (TSLA) said it sold 139,300 vehicles in the quarter ended  Sept. 30 , slightly ahead of the 137,000 estimate. The figure topped the previous high of 112,000 vehicles and 44% above last year..
* Ring, a company owned by Amazon (AMZN), announced a new security camera for cars. The first vehicle manufacturer Ring has integrated this API with is Tesla. Will be able to install a device that allows them to connect eight exterior cameras and view footage on their phones.
* United Wholesale Mortgage announced this week it will merge with special purpose acquisition company Gores Holdings in a deal that would value the firm at $16.1 billion.
* Caliber Home Loans, one of the largest U.S. mortgage lenders is preparing for an IPO that could value the company at more than $2 billion.
* Twilio (TWLO) has a myriad of target raises including Oppenheimer, Wells Fargo, Piper Sandler, Morgan Stanley, Cowen, Robert W. Baird, and Needham. Most target at $315 or higher.
* Twilio (TWLO) ran today after the company said in a filing that it expects more third-quarter revenue than the $401 million to $406 million range it had provided in August.

Stocks slumped Thursday once again, continuing the recent sellof. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) led the selloff, falling 1.64%. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell 1.24% and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell 1.07%. At session lows, both the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500 erased 2021s gains. 

The moves lower came even after a new report on weekly unemployment claims came in better than expected, pointing to improving employment trends. 

* **Initial jobless claims:** 745,000 vs. 750,000 expected and a revised 736,000 during the prior week. 
* **Continuing claims:** 4.295 million vs. 4.300 million expected and 4.419 million during the prior week

During a public appearance Thursday afternoon, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Thursday that the central bank will be patient in keeping interest rates near zero, even if inflationary pressures start to rise. Powell cautioned that as the COVID-19 vaccine rollout continues, the Fed could see signs of rising prices amid surging consumer spending. But the Fed chairman noted that he does not expect higher inflation to turn into anything resembling the double-digit inflation of the 1970s. He said, If we do see what we believe is likely a transitory increase in inflation, where longer-term inflation expectations are broadly stable at levels consistent with our framework and goals, I expect that we will be patient.

As Treasury yields continue to rise, market participants are increasingly rotating out of high-growth names that led the markets in 2020. Technology stocks came under exceptional selling pressure as traders turned their focus to stocks poised to benefit more directly from an impending economic reopening. At the same time, the recent, rapid rise in Treasury yields has also deterred investors from growth stocks, with interest rates closely tied to borrowing costs for companies and consumers. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed to around 1.544% at the time of writing. 

In other news, lawmakers in the Senate are set to begin debating President Bidens $1.9 trillion stimulus, which was passed by the House of Representatives recently. Democrats are racing to push the legislation forward before the mid-March expiry of augmented Federal unemployment benefits. Republicans do not support the bill because of its size, but through a process called reconciliation, Democrats will be able to pass the bill without support from the other side of the aisle.

**Highlights**

* The decisions by Britain and the United States to suspend retaliatory tariffs will create space for negotiations on an ongoing dispute between Boeing (BA) and Airbus, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Thursday. 
* President Biden said his administration expects to have enough COVID-19 vaccines for any adult that wants it by the end of May, pulling the targets two months closer than the previous government estimate.
* U.S. mortgage rates extended their recent leg higher to break above 3% for the first time since July 2020, raising concerns that the housing market's breakneck growth last year may sharply lose momentum.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, January 6, 2022**

After the worst day for technology stocks since March, the market finished modestly lower in a very volatile session, with stocks dropping hard in the morning before recovering throughout the session as market participants continue to digest signals from the Fed that an interest rate hike may come relatively soon. 

Despite the imminent interest rate hike and elevated inflation, it seems market participants are eagerly buying up the dip, with volume in both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) surging (86 million shares traded vs 65 million average in SPY &amp; 70 million shares traded vs 41 million average in the Nasdaq).

Looking ahead, the Department of Labors December job report is due for release Friday., which will shed more light on the state of the labor market. 

**Notable Numbers** 

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -0.09%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -0.07%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.47%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +0.57%
* Volatility Index: -0.61%
* Facebook (FB): +2.99%
* Alibaba (BABA): +4.65%
* Ford Motors (F): +3.38%
* Humana (HUM): -19.56%
* Allbird (BIRDS): +11.86%
* Gamestop (GME): +30% after-hours
* Beyond Meat (BYND): +14.65%

The Labor Departments December monthly job report will offer a meaningful look into the strength of hiring and labor force participation - two key measures to gauge the health of the labor market, especially amid rising prices and surging Omicron cases. Economists are expecting the economy to add 444,000 new jobs.

Additionally, market participants weighed on todays weekly unemployment report, which showed the first-time unemployment claims ticked up compared to the previous week but remain near 52-week lows, signaling a continued recovery in the labor market. Here are the numbers: 

* **Initial jobless claims, week ended Jan. 1:** 207,000 vs. 195,000 expected and a revised 200,000 during the prior week
* **Continuing claims, week ended Dec. 25:** 1.754 million vs. 1.678 million expected and a revised 1.718 million during the prior week.

On Wednesday, the markets sold off after the Feds meeting minutes suggested the Central Bank was considering accelerating the timeline for a potential interest rate hike amid strengthening economic recovery and elevated inflation. 

The meeting minutes said, Participants generally noted that, given their individual outlooks for the economy, the labor market, and inflation, it may become warranted to increase the federal funds rate sooner or at a faster pace than participants had earlier anticipated. Some participants also noted that it could be appropriate to begin to reduce the size of the Federal Reserves balance sheet relatively soon after beginning to raise the federal funds rate."" 

Moreover, the minutes said, Almost all participants agreed that it would likely be appropriate to initiate balance sheet runoff at some point after the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.

Here is the entire meeting minutes: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20211215.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20211215.pdf)

* Shares of Beyond Meat (BYND) gapped up roughly 15% ahead of KFC menu item debut across the US

After weeks of volatility, stocks rallied today as fears over rising inflation forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy tempered. As I have said for weeks, there are several reasons I thought the initial reaction to the April Consumer Price Index, which saw the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) lose 4% in three trading days, was overdone and I am glad to have taken advantage of the dip particularly in technology stocks. The SPY closed 1.01% and is only 3 points away from its all-time high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.68% higher and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed .56% higher. 

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures transitory.

Moreover, while the market was shaken by the April Consumer Index, as has been reiterated in the recap before, the Federal Reserve has consistently said they are looking towards significant progress in the labor market before any significant adjustments to monetary policy are considered. In the Federal Reserves April meeting minutes, participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committees maximum-employment and price-stability goals.  Jerome Powell and other monetary officials have reiterated several times that they want to see a string of strong labor reports before major adjustments to policy are considered. The April Job Reports showed only 266,000 jobs added back to the economy, widely missing analyst expectations and marking a sharp deceleration in job growth from March, bolsters that argument.

On a slightly sour note, the meeting minutes also said a number of participants suggested that as the economy continues to quickly, it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase, which have currently been going at a rate of $120 billion per month. However, its important to note the meeting toke place before the release of the April Jobs report, which greatly bolsters Powell and other monetary officials' argument that the labor market remains below the Feds targets and roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic times. onth. However, this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before. Back in an April 14 meeting, Powell said, We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance. As a reminder, quantitative easing is a process in which the Fed buys government bonds in order to inject money into the economy. It is only natural that as the economy recovers, less money needs to be injected into the economy in this manner. The Federal Reserve gave absolutely no signal it was even considering beginning discussion on raising interest rates, which is what market participants are really concerned about.

Michael Jones, CEO of Caravel Concepts said, I do think it's been a pretty healthy sideways chop. It's taken out some of the speculative excess. The biggest pullbacks have been in some of the most pricey names. That all feels very healthy to me.

**Highlights**

* The court case between Epic Games and Apple (AAPL) s expected to end this week as both sides prepare closing arguments. As a reminder, Epic Games is accusing Apple of antitrust behavior by taking a 30% commission from sales in the app store and blocking companies from using third-party payment options. Apple says it prevents third-party software to ensure consumer protection and the commission is in-line with other app-store developers, like Alphabet. The result of this case will have very wide ranging implications.
* Amazon (AMZN) is reportedly nearing a deal to buy the Hollywood studio MGM for roughly $9 billion, in a deal that would turn the movie studio into a streaming asset for AMZN. According to people familiar with the matter, a deal could close as soon as next week.
* Investors have rejected a record number of executive compensation plans in non-binding votes of U.S.-listed companies this year, objecting to pay rises and the easing of performance targets in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an analysis by consulting firm ISS Corporate Solutions. I hope this trend continues moving forward and urge shareholders to continue voting no on potential compensation plans. A record 14 S&amp;P 500 companies had more than 50% of investors reject executive pay packages so far this year.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, December 6, 2021**

After last weeks extremely volatile trading, stocks bounced on Monday, as investors continued weighing the potential impact of the new coronavirus Omicron variant and looked ahead towards the monthly Consumer Price Index, set to be released later this week, which will give us more information regarding the pace and potential staying power of inflation. 

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +1.18%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): +0.80%
* Dow Jones (DIA): +1.90%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +2.01%
* Volatility Index (VIX): -7.80%
* Del Taco (TACO): +65.60%
* BioNTech (BNTX): -18.34%
* Moderna (MRNA): -13.49%
* Airbnb (ABNB): +8.46%
* Crude Oil (WTI): +4.44%

Some encouraging developments about the Omicron variant helped boost risk assets today. During an appearance on CNN today, Fauci said that preliminary data and reports coming out of South Africa, where Omicron was originally discovered November 24, suggest the severity of the virus is not as bad as originally feared. Fauci said, Clearly, in South Africa, omicron has a transmission advantage. And although its too early to make any definitive statements about it, thus far it does not look like theres a great degree of severity to it. But weve really got to be careful before we make any determinations that it is less severe, or really doesnt cause any severe illness comparable to delta, but thus far the signals are a bit encouraging regarding the severity. 

Like I said last week during my recaps, it was way too early to panic regarding Omicron, I remember the same song and dance happening after the discovery of Delta, which ended up being one of the juiciest dips all year. Its still too early to make any conclusions, but the data is so far very encouraging. Im personally nibbling at some stocks last week and today. 

Meanwhile, however, Moderna (MRNA) President Stephen Hoge told ABC on Sunday that there was a ""real risk that we're going to see a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccines"" currently available as the Omicron variant spreads. The vaccine-maker had also said last week it could have a COVID-19 booster shot designed to address the Omicron variant available as soon as March. CEO Stephane Bancel said something very similar last week. Not to be too conspiratorial, but it is in the interest of these companies to produce a new booster vaccine to boost profits. I personally trust public health officials over CEOs and executives, though again, more data is needed to make any conclusions.

J. Pows latest remarks before the Senate Banking Committee further spooked the markets, after he said he would back off from using the word transitory to describe rising inflation. This is very notable because the Central bank has been using the T-word since the beginning of the year, when it warned that steep differences in year-over-year comparisons and supply-chain bottlenecks would lead to elevated inflation. 

Powell said, We tend to use \[the word transitory\] to mean that it wont leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation. I think its probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean.

Moreover, Powell suggested the Central Bank was considering completing its asset purchase taper a few months sooner than previously telegraphed. Market participants expected a more supportive stance, especially with the new COVID variant, but instead Powell suggested his priority was now on curbing higher than expected inflation. 

Again, this is simply my humble opinion. As I have said for months at this point, I am unconcerned regarding tapering the pace of quantitative easing. I remain bullish until the Fed begins concretely discussing plans to raise the interest rate, which the Fed currently telegraphs to happen around the middle of next year, according to the Feds dot-plot. Again, this is simply my opinion, dont get too worked up about it (been weirdly getting a lot of aggressive comments because of this opinion from doom and gloomers). As always, I acknowledge the risks and am prepared to act if it turns out I am incorrect.

**Highlights**

* Tesla (TSLA) stock gapped down in the morning, before mostly recovering by market close, after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it was investigating a report from a whistleblower that alleges that Tesla did not properly inform buyers that defective electrical connectors on the panel could cause fires.
* Lucid Motors (LCID), another EV company, is also being investigated by the SEC. Lucid said the probe appears to concern the merger that took the company public along with certain projections and statements made by the company prior to becoming public. 
* The Nasdaq Inc is geared to eclipse rival New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in initial public offerings (IPO) this year, which has seen companies raise record levels of capital. Nasdaq raised a total of $191.38 billion through IPOs in 2021, compared with $109.25 billion raised at the NYSE, according to data from Dealogic.
* Shares of Alibaba (BABA) broke (at least briefly) from its death spiral to climb roughly 10% after the company announced it was reorganizing its e-commerce team and naming a new Chief Financial Officer in the face of tightening regulation, increasing competition, slowing growth, and a more than 60% loss in stock price.
* The Department of Justice opened an investigation into allegations that Apple (AAPL) is unevenly enforcing its rules for app developers, favoring some like Roblox (RBLX) at the expense of others.
* Microsoft (MSFT) won Yahoo Finance company of the year
* **\*\*Please note that current price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\*\***

Stocks dipped across the board today, putting a stop to the recent record-setting rally that has seen both the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&amp;P 500 (SPY) reach countless fresh intraday highs in the last six weeks or so. The SPY and Dow Jones (DIA) both fell roughly 0.9% while the tech-heavy QQQ fared slightly better, closing 0.65% down. It seems there a few differing factors that contributed to the drop today, including but not limited to, (1) rising coronavirus fears outside of the US due to the highly contagious Delta variant, (2) the Feds June Meeting Minutes, which showed members are increasingly talking about accelerating the timeline to taper quantitative easing, (3) a disappointing weekly unemployment report, and (4) general profit-taking after such a monster rally in the market. In positive news, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield sank for the fourth straight day, hovering around a multi-month low at 1.29%, a sign that inflation fears are further tapering. 

In a sign of rising concerns over the highly contagious coronavirus delta variant, the Japanese made a last minute announcement that a state of emergency would be re-instituted across Tokyo and that all events would take place behind closed doors, with no spectators, walking back an earlier decision to allow locals to attend the games. On Wednesday, 16 days before the Opening Ceremony, the [Tokyo Metropolitan Government reported 920 COVID cases](https://stopcovid19.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/en), over 200 more than any other single-day total since May. On Thursday, it reported 896, the second-highest count since May. Other countries, like India and Brazil, are also dealing with an extremely worrying surge of cases. Even in the US, where roughly 50% of those eligible are fully vaccinated, the country is seeing a small surge in cases recently, with the delta variant accounting for 51.7% of all new infections. 

Yesterday, the Federal Reserve released the June Meeting minutes, which are notes about what was discussed in the latest meeting, which helps market participants decipher that path forward for monetary policy and possible timelines for any adjustments. The Fed said the economic recovery was generally seen as not having yet been met, but said they are ready to act if inflationary pressures indeed begin to materialize. The minutes said, Participants generally judged that, as a matter of prudent planning, it was important to be well positioned to reduce the pace of asset purchases, if appropriate, in response to unexpected economic developments, including faster-than anticipated progress toward the Committees goals or the emergence of risks that could impede the attainment of the Committees goals. This is not surprising, as I have been saying for weeks now, as the pace of economic recovery improves, quantitative easing, or the purchase of government bonds in order to inject money into the economy, is always the first policy to be tapered. I am not worried about the tapering of quantitative easing and encourage everyone to read up about the 2013 Taper Tantrum, which happened when the Fed announced QE would be tapered since the economy had largely recovered from the 2008 crisis by then.

In other news, after a strong run of outperformance in reports about the labor market, the most recent weekly unemployment report showed new jobless claims unexpectedly tick higher. According to the Department of Labor, there were 373,000 new jobless claims filed last week, higher than the 350,000 expected. While it is slightly disappointing, jobless claims in the US have been continuously declining for months, a sign that the labor market continues to improve as the US continues to reopen.

Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said, The consensus ignored the tendency for unadjusted claims to rise in weeks when July 4 falls on a Sunday, so the risk was always to the upside. But this is noise, not signal. The seasonal adjustments are struggling simultaneously with the July 4 holiday period and the annual automakers retooling shutdowns, which can make the headline numbers even more volatile than usual. The noise will persist through late July, but we have no doubt that the underlying trend will remain downwards."" I agree and remain encouraged by the pace of recovery in the labor market. 

Another potential explanation for todays pullback, coupled with the other reasons listed, may be general profit taking after such a monster run by the broader market. Since mid-May, the Nasdaq and SPY are up 12.3% and 6% respectively, a great run by any judgement. Nothing ever goes straight up, sometimes dips are needed for the market to recharge for another move higher. 

Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for Q2 earnings season, which is set to kick off next week with big banks reporting. 

**Highlights**

* The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary showed U.S. job openings increased to 9.209 million in May. This followed a downwardly revised 9.193 million in April, which was brought down from the 9.286 million previously reported
* U.S. mortgage applications declined for a second straight week last week, declining to the lowest level in a year-and-a-half as home price growth and low housing inventories weighed further on purchasing activity. 
* The NFL and Twitter (TWTR) are extending a media partnership that will leverage Twitter Spaces, the social-media network's live-audio feature. The NFL says it has more than 20 Spaces sessions planned for the upcoming season; they will include participation from players and other NFL personalities. Other aspects of the partnership will include postings of curated videos, Twitter polls and other content.
* Airbus delivered 297 airplanes in the first half of the year after a surge of handover activity in June, the European planemaker said on Thursday. US-rival Boeing (BA), on the other hand, has more orders in the books for planes but only managed to deliver 111 planes so far this year.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, August 26, 2021**

Stocks fell, with all three major indexes logging their first day of losses following a remarkable five-day winning streak despite elevated volatility following the release of the Feds July meeting minutes. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) retreated from record levels, falling 0.59% and 0.63% respectively. The Dow Jones (DIA) fell 0.57% while the Russell 2000, which tracks the performance of small-caps, broke its streak of outperformance to finish 1.06% down. Market participants are digesting a key Federal Reserve event and a speech by chairman Jerome Powell tomorrow. Market participants are looking for any new clues regarding a taper timeline that might emerge.

The annual Jackson Hole Symposium is a conference that brings together members of the Federal Reserve, economists, policymakers, academics, and government officials in order to discuss issues and challenges relevant to monetary policy and the stock market. The Feds July meeting minutes stated about a potential taper timeline, looking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as anticipated, they judged it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year. As the Jackson Hole meeting kicks off, market participants are anxiously waiting to see if any more information or details regarding the taper timeline are divulged.

In my opinion, which is shared by many pundits, Powell will likely keep his messaging in line with his other recent public remarks, signaling the economy has progressed toward the central bank's goals while still remaining a ways off from fully reaching the thresholds necessary to begin tapering.

Wells Fargo Senior Macro Strategist Zach Griffiths said, We dont think the Fed is going to do anything suddenly, and we really dont think Chairman Powell is going to indicate that theyre ready to move policy anytime soon. If you look at the July FOMC statement, they did indicate that they have seen progress toward their goals, but if you listen to \[Powells\] press conference, he really walked that back and said they are still a ways off from the substantial further progress threshold. So we expect Chairman Powell to remain resolutely dovish.

The selloff in stocks intensified after a report that showed the consumer price index (CPI) rose at a faster-than-expected pace, spooking market participants about the prospects of inflationary pressures, increasing pressure on equities. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 2.09% down, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell 2.54%, while the Dow Industrial Average (DIA) fell 2%, the worst slump since February.

The Bureau of Labor statistics reported that the consumer price index, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. This confirms fears market participants have had for months. Tomorrow, the producer price index will be released, which is expected to show a similar spike like the CPI. 

Market participants are worried that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, the surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices, which, in turn, may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks. However, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be transitory as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a string of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. In an April 28 meeting Powell said, Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.

While the inflationary readings are definitely not good, they werent unexpected and with the SPY trading near record levels for consecutive weeks and the stretched valuation of some technology, this weeks sell-off is not unexpected. In my opinion, the current fear around the equity market seems overblown, and though I expect volatility going forward, my long-term outlook remains bullish and will be looking to take advantage of this dip in the indexes and mega-caps. 

Moreover, the April Job Report, released last Friday, showed the US economy only added 266,000 new jobs last month, missing estimates of more than 1 million jobs gained and marking a sharp deceleration from Marchs total of 916,000 new jobs added. As said earlier, members of the Federal Reserve, including Powell, have consistently reiterated they want to see a   
String of strong labor reports before considering any changes to the current policy. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, theres a very large group of people who are not. The April Job Report bolsters Powells argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper well before the interest rate is increased. He said, We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance. In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, Im fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner than expected are overblown.

The market staged another remarkable reversal today, with many names that were hit yesterday clawing back their losses. The three major indexes were mixed, with Nasdaq (QQQ) climbing 0.35%. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) dipped towards the end of the session to close 0.6%  down. The Dow Jones (DIA), which tracks industrial and financial stocks, fell 0.37%. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, outperformed, rising 1.53% at the time of writing. Just like last Monday, today demonstrates that, while there are risks present in the market, investors and traders remain eager to buy up every dip.

Today, market participants continue to digest a slew of earnings reports, with three of the largest companies in the market, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) reporting yesterday. Today, after-hours, Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL) are reporting, among many others. 

Moreover, market participants also eyed the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) July Monetary Policy Report, which largely reiterated what members of the Fed have been saying for months, but did include some new language hinting that the economic recovery is getting closer to the Feds stated goals. The statement read, Last December, the Committee indicated that it would continue to increase its holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgagebacked securities by at least $40 billion per month until substantial further progress has been made toward its maximum employment and price stability goals. Since then, the economy has made progress toward these goals, and the Committee will continue to assess progress in coming meetings. In other words, the Fed says substantial progress has been made and that in the coming months, we will increasingly begin to hear more about a timeline to taper quantitative easing. 

On inflation, the statement largely reiterated what it has in months past. The statement read, Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses and The Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of 2 percent over the longer run. With inflation having run persistently below this longer-run goal, the Committee will aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longerterm inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent. The Committee expects to maintain an accommodative stance of monetary policy until these outcomes are achieved.

However, the report did acknowledge potential risks and stated the Fed was ready to act if appropriate risks arise. The statement read, In assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee would be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals. The Committee's assessments will take into account a wide range of information, including readings on public health, labor market conditions, inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments.

Shares of Facebook (FB) fell 5% after-hours despite largely beating analyst after the company warned of a significant slowdown moving forward. Here are the numbers.

* **Earnings:** $3.61 per share, adjusted, vs. $3.03 per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.
* **Revenue:** $29.08 billion, vs. $27.89 billion as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.
* **Daily active users (DAUs):** 1.91 billion, vs. 1.91 billion as expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.
* **Monthly active users (MAUs):** 2.90 billion, vs. 2.91 billion as expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.
* **Average revenue per user (ARPU):** $10.12, vs. $9.66 as expected by analysts, according to StreetAccount.

Importantly, however, with respect to guidance, Facebook warned of a significant deceleration in growth moving forward. The company said it expects year-over-year total revenue growth rates to decelerate significantly on a sequential basis as we lap periods of increasingly strong growth.

**Highlights**

* Twitter (TWTR) stock surged roughly 5% before moderating after the company announced it was testing a new feature called the Shop Module that would enable businesses to sell their products directly through the Twitter platform. 
* Quarterly revenue for LinkedIn, the professional social network owned by tech giant Microsoft, surpassed $1 billion in the quarter for the first time.
* Youtube, which is owned by Alphabet, reported revenues of $7 billion for the quarter. To put into context how massive YouTube really is, Netflix (NFLX) had $7.3 billion in revenue this quarter, which has a $230 billion market-cap. Its funny, in a world where the competition between streaming services for professional content is becoming increasingly more saturated, YouTube is poised to become and doesnt spend billions to produce and acquire content. 
* Shares of chip-maker AMD gapped up today after the company beat earnings estimates and raised guidance moving forward that suggests the company will continue to take market share away from Intel. As Ive said before, I think AMD and NVDA are the kings of this space.

The *overwhelming sentiment* was more pain in 2023, with the market starting to recover in late 2023. The sentiment for Q1 was pretty much unanimously negative. From what I can see, pretty much ZERO people predicted a strong rally in Q1/Q2.  People who predicted any kind of positive gains in 2023 were downvoted (sort by controversial).

**Today, after 6 months, SPY is up +16% and QQQ is up a staggering +40%.**

I hope this helps to demonstrate how difficult it is to predict the market (and yet people do it with such confidence every day, just look at the prediction thread).

Investing is one of those strange things where the more research you do and the more trades you make, the worse you tend to do.

The sooner that you realize how difficult it is to time the market successfully, the better your performance will be.

As always, I recommend a DCA strategy into market ETF's and hold long term.

After suffering one of the worst days all year yesterday, stocks stabilized today, with the three major indexes trading modestly green as Treasury yields pulled back from multi-month highs. Lots of dynamics affecting the market right, with market participants closely monitoring developments out of Washington D.C, communications from the Fed, and ongoing situations in China. 

Yesterday, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield spiked to as much as 1.56%, the highest level since June, which pressured tech stocks, causing the Nasdaq (QQQ) to fall by more than 2.5% yesterday. Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks, like technology, the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunities to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. While higher yields are generally seen as a bet on a strengthening economic environment, it does make it more expensive to borrow capital, which weighs heavily on growth stocks, which are valued heavily based on future earnings projections.

Timothy Chubb, Chief Investment Officer at advisory firm Girard, said Yesterdays selloff was really largely driven by rate movement. It wasnt necessarily the size of the rate movement, but the speed that it took place. The yield gained more than 16 basis points from its low last Friday to yesterdays peak. 

Congress members continue to race in order to pass legislation to fund the government until next year and prevent the government from defaulting and shutting down, which Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warning the US must raise the debt limit by October 18 in order to avoid a default. This comes amid a backdrop of ongoing debates surrounding the bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure deal. Last night, Republicans refused to pass a bill to avert a government shutdown and raise or suspend the debt limit to prevent the US from defaulting on its debts. Unfortunately, something that is fairly routine (the debt ceiling has been raised 80 times since 1960 and three times under President Trump, with the latest suspension in 2019) has become a headline with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stating that he would not provide the Republican votes necessary.

Jason Grumet, Bipartisan Policy Center President, said It is really important that we separate the shutdown, which is terrible, from the debt limit, which is catastrophic. There could be, I think, a very short shutdown of the government Friday night going into Saturday, Sunday. And I think that you would then see a short continuing resolution to get the government running again. The government shutdown really isnt the problem were grappling with. The problem we're grappling with really is the debt ceiling. Democrats tried to join them together. That did not make the sale for Republicans. Some Democrats have a different approach to the debt ceiling. But I am not particularly concerned about a government shutdown."" 

Penduing home sales have greatly exceed expectations in August, rebounding spectacularly from the July dip to jump to the highest level in seven-months. Pending home sales rose 8.1% in August month-on-month, according to the [National Association of Realtors](https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/pending-home-sales-recover-8-1-in-august). This exceeded estimates for a 1.4% monthly rise, based on Bloomberg consensus data. In July, pending home sales fell by 2.0%. Pending home sales are -6.3% down compared to last year.

Lawrence Yun, the NARs Chief Economist, said Rising inventory and moderating price conditions are bringing buyers back to the market. Affordability, however, remains challenging as home prices are roughly three times wage growth.

Losses in the stock market accelerated today as market participants nervously eyed rising coronavirus case counts in the US and Europe, the presidential election a mere 6 days away, and developments out of Washington regarding stimulus.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) slid 3.90$ down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell 3.41%, and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell 3.35%.

In the United States, there were 73,240 coronavirus cases reported yesterday, according to Johns Hopkins University. Alarmingly, the average number of daily new cases in the US rose  21% compared to the previous week. According to an article from CNN Health, the surge is hitting all parts of the country, with 40 states reporting at least a 10% increase in daily average cases, compared to last week. Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University School of Public Health, said, Cases are rising quickly. If we go back about six, seven weeks ago to Labor Day, we \[the United States\] were at about 35,000 cases a day.  U.S. hospitalizations related to COVID-19 have risen by at least 10% over the past week across 32 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. One good thing is the FDA approval of remdesivir, a therapeutic developed by Gildead (GILD) that was used to treat the president.

In Europe, the average number of daily cases rose by 33% compared to last week, accounting for the greatest proportion of new cases in the world, according to data compiled from worldometer.info. France is the hardest hit country in Europe. On Tuesday, it reported more than 33,400 new cases and 523 coronavirus deaths in 24 hours, as well as a net increase of 74 admissions to intensive care, bringing the total  to 2,918, over half the country's overall capacity of 5,800. French President Emmanuel Macron announced nationwide restrictions for the next four weeks. Germany joined France, imposing its own four-week nationwide lockwide, which includes curfew and restrictions on businesses like gyms, bars, restaurants, hairdressers etc.

Yesterday, President Trump publicly acknowledged that an agreement on additional stimulus would not happen until after the election. While he signaled that his administration was still willing to negotiate, with the election a mere 6 days away, the chances of stimulus passing before then are practically zero.

Stocks shook off yesterdays jitteriness and powered higher, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) recording fresh intraday highs while the treasury yield fell as market participants considered a key speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, vastly outperformed on the day, rising roughly 3% at the time of writing. The Dow Jones (DIA) remains slightly below record-levels. 

Today, Powell gave his annual Jackson Hole speech, which provided a fuller picture on what his thinking is regarding the pace of economic recovery and inflation in light of the recent threats by the highly contagious coronavirus Delta variant. Despite some comments by more hawkish Fed members that favor tapering the pace of quantitative easing (QE) sooner-rather-than-later, Powell remained highly accommodative, suggesting he was more inclined to wait to see further progress in the economy before tapering QE, especially in light of surging infections due to the Delta variant. Powell said, At the FOMC's recent July meeting, I was of the view, as were most participants, that if the economy evolved broadly as anticipated, it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year. The intervening month has brought more progress in the form of a strong employment report for July, but also the further spread of the Delta variant. We will be carefully assessing incoming data and the evolving risks. Even after our asset purchases end, our elevated holdings of longer-term securities will continue to support accommodative financial conditions.

Powell once again urged caution since the economic recovery in the market is still undergoing, saying effects from an ill-timed policy shift would arrive after the need has passed and could be particularly harmful. Here is the full quote, The main influence of monetary policy on inflation can come after a lag of a year or more. If a central bank tightens policy in response to factors that turn out to be temporary, the main policy effects are likely to arrive after the need has passed. The ill-timed policy move unnecessarily slows hiring and other economic activity and pushes inflation lower than desired. Today, with substantial slack remaining in the labor market and the pandemic continuing, such a mistake could be particularly harmful. We know that extended periods of unemployment can mean lasting harm to workers and to the productive capacity of the economy.

Regarding inflation, Powell once again reiterated his view that current inflationary pressures are transitory and broadly due to pandemic-induced factors but suggested he was prepared to act if incoming data deems it appropriate. He said, Central banks have always faced the problem of distinguishing transitory inflation spikes from more troublesome developments, and it is sometimes difficult to do so with confidence in real time. At such times, there is no substitute for a careful focus on incoming data and evolving risks. If sustained higher inflation were to become a serious concern, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would certainly respond and use our tools to assure that inflation runs at levels that are consistent with our goal. Incoming data should provide more evidence that some of the supplydemand imbalances are improving, and more evidence of a continued moderation in inflation, particularly in goods and services prices that have been most affected by the pandemic. We also expect to see continued strong job creation. And we will be learning more about the Delta variant's effects.

Here is the full transcript from the speech, I encourage everyone to read it fully. Its not very long and is extremely insightful to see exactly what the main monetary policy maker thinks of the current state of the economy

* ESPN, which is owned by Disney (DIS), is reportedly seeking to license its brand to major sports-betting companies for at least $3 billions over several years, according to sources familiar with the matter as reported by the Wall Street Journal. On offer is the right for a suitor to use the ESPN name for branding purposes and potentially rename its sportsbook after ESPN. The sports-media giant has held talks with players that own major sportsbooks, including casino operator Caesars Entertainment (CZR)[ ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CZR?mod=chiclets)and DraftKings (DKNG) the sources said. ESPN has existing marketing partnerships with both companies already. This is huge for the sports-betting industry, will be closely following this story.
* The Chinese city of Tianjin, which has a population of roughly 14 million people, reportedly asked all municipal governments and government-controlled firms to migrate their data from private sector operators like Alibaba (BABA) and Tencent (TCEHY) into a state-controlled cloud database. This comes as regulatory pressure in China intensifies against tech companies.
* Amazon-backed (AMZN) electric vehicle maker Rivian is reportedly seeking a $70-$80 billion valuation in its upcoming IPO. The company has an agreement to produce electric vans for Amazon and a pickup truck for consumers. In my humble opinion, even being backed by Amazon, this valuation is insane.
* Apple (AAPL) announced changes to its App Store regulations that will allow software developers to tell customers how to pay for services outside of Apples ecosystem, part of a proposed settlement of a class-action lawsuit. The shift will make it easier for some apps to steer customers toward other forms of payment, rather than using the App Store, where Apple charges a commission of up to 30%.

After a bounce in the market yesterday, Volatility resumed, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) selling off hard amid a big sell-off in technology stocks poised to suffer under a more hawkish Federal Reserve. Market participants continue to digest the Feds latest monetary policy decision, which doubled the pace of tapering.

First-time unemployment filings totaled 206,000[ up from last weeks half-century](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/weekly-unemployment-claims-week-ended-dec-11-2021-200522770.html) low but down overall even compared to before the pandemic, reflecting labor market tightness brought on by a lingering shortage of workers. 

In Washington, President Biden signed a bill that would raise the debt limit to once again avert a default by the US government. 

the Fed announced it would double the pace of tapering and signaled a strong likelihood that there would be an interest hike, probably around August-September (according to the Feds dot-plot), the first since rates were slashed to near zero in March 2020. This was largely the expected outcome of this meeting. 

The new pacing would bring all asset purchases to a full stop by March 2022, faster than the course set forth in November that originally sought to end purchases by the middle of next year. The decision had unanimous agreement.

A quicker taper gives the Fed room to move earlier on interest rate hikes. All of the 18 members present at the meeting said they could see the case for at least one rate hike next year, a noticeable revision up from [September projections showing a 50-50 split on a 2022 rate hike](https://news.yahoo.com/fed-fomc-monetary-policy-decision-september-2021-141145429.html).

The Fed said, Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to elevated levels of inflation.

The median expectation of the committee sees core personal consumption expenditures, the Feds preferred measure of inflation, clocking in at 2.6% in 2022 (compared to 2.2% in the Feds September projections). Core PCE came in at 4.1% in October (data for November core PCE comes out December 23.

* IHS Markit's preliminary December U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) registered at 57.8, coming in below November's 58.3. Consensus economists had been looking for a slight increase in the index to 58.5, according to Bloomberg data. Readings above the neutral level of 50.0 indicate expansion in a sector. 
* Housing starts rose 11.8% on a month-over-month basis in November, [the Commerce Department said on Thursday. ](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf)This easily topped estimates for the 3.1% increase expected

* Tax preparation company H&amp;R Block Inc on Thursday sued payment company Block Inc, previously called Square Inc, saying the new name infringed its trademarks.
* New car sales in the US are expected to rise next year, driven by pent up demand as automakers were forced to cut production in 2020 and 2021 amid the semiconductor shortage. Edmunds expects 15.2 million more cars will be sold in 2022, a 1.2% increase despite higher prices.

Stocks jumped on Monday, continuing their strong performance from last Friday, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) recording fresh highs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) outperformed, closing the day 2% up. Market participants remain encouraged by President Bidens recent infrastructure proposal, a better-than-expect monthly job report, and are looking ahead to a week of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members. 

The March Jobs Report blew past consensus estimates to record the fastest pace of job growth since last summer. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%. Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial said, It \[the jobs report\] shows that the economy is healing, that those who lost their jobs are coming back into the workforce as the recovery continues and restrictions are lifted.

President Bidens plan, called the American Jobs Plan, proposes to spend $2.25 trillion over 8 years to rehabilitate and build out the nations transportation infrastructure, expand domestic manufacturing and workforce development, modernize the electrical grid, and fund the research, development, and implementation of clean energy technologies. See a full list of items from the bill [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-infrastructure-plan-details-113700242.html).

Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard are each slated to deliver public remarks later this week, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) panel regarding the global economy Thursday afternoon. In a note to client, Wells Fargo economist Sam Bullard said,  ""While the consensus of the FOMC continues to suggest that the committee will wait for their forecasts to be realized before taking policy action, it will be interesting to see if there is any intense discussion about the implications of the stronger outlook, particularly around inflation. Most Fed officials expect any pick-up in inflation to be transitory, yet we suspect there are a few officials that are pushing back on that narrative."" 

**Highlights**

* Shares of Gamestop (GME) sank after the company announced it may sell up to $1 billion worth of additional shares. 
* Shares of Tesla gapped up more than 4% after the company reported better than expected March delivery numbers. Other EV companies also posted better-than-expected deliveries but didnt rise nearly as much.

Stocks rose on Friday, largely recovering after a sharp sell-off yesterday following news that President Biden was planning a proposal to increase the capital gains tax rate on wealthy individuals. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 1.10% up, recording a fresh intraday high. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.67% up and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.26% higher.

Yesterday, stocks sold off sharply following a report by [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/biden-to-propose-capital-gains-tax-as-high-as-43-4-for-wealthy) suggesting President Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals earning $1 million or more per year to 39.6% to help pay for a slew of social programs and the proposed infrastructure bill. The new 39.6% rate would almost double the tax rate from the current base rate of 20%,  people familiar with the matter said on the condition of anonymity because the plan is not yet public. The proposal could reverse a long-standing provision of the tax code that taxes returns on investment lower than on labor salary. 

However, the sharp bounce-back in equities today suggests the initial sell off was overdone. As we have suggested in previous recaps, the current high valuations of many companies even as corporate earnings blow past analyst expectations suggest there is froth in the market. In other words, the market is pricing in the most positive news, so it is not surprising to see any bad news sparking a sharp selloff. As Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab said, I think the immediate reaction was probably a bit overdone. These proposals come out and you never know, especially with tax proposals, where we'll end up. So it looks like an opening bid. I'm sure there will be intense lobbying from the investment community to adjust those numbers. But I think at the moment, when you have very high valuations in the market, anything that is bad news can spark a bit of a sell-off.""

In other news, the Labor Departments Weekly Unemployment Report blew past analyst expectations for the second straight, signaling improving conditions in the labor market and corroborating the pick-up in economic activity as the economy reopens. 

* **Initial jobless claims, week ended April** **17:** 547,000 vs. 610,000 expected and below last week's total of 576,000
* **Continuing claims, week ended April 3:** 3.674 million vs. 3.650 million expected and below last weeks total of 3.708 million

Stocks rose today, reversing course after being deep in the red the last two days. Market participants digested a record increase in third-quarter GDP for the US, a better-than-expected weekly unemployment report, new coronavirus restrictions in the US and Europe and a slew of corporate earnings for massive companies.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 1.75% today, the best performing of the major indices. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 1.05% up and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.44%.

After coming off one of the worst quarters in US history, the economy rebounded, growing at its fastest pace ever. Gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of the total goods and services produced from July to September of this year, expanded at a 33.1% annualized pace, according to the report by the Department of Commerce. The gain came after a 31.4% plunge in the second quarter and was better than the 32% estimate from economists surveyed by Dow Jones. The previous record was the post-World War II 16.7% surge in the first quarter of 1950.

Today, the US Department of Commerce released its weekly unemployment report, showing that another 751,000 individuals filed initial jobless claims, better than the 770,000 estimated by analysts.  Continuing claims, which refer to individuals that are currently receiving unemployment benefits who filed for unemployment benefits at least two weeks ago, was 7.75 million, slightly better than the 7.77 million expected. According to Yahoo Finance, this report represents the ninth-straight week initial unemployment claims have remained below 1 million and continuing claims below 10 million, a key indicator that the economy is recovering, though not as fast as many would like.

In Europe, countries are still struggling to contain the recent surge in coronavirus infections. Both France and Germany announced renewed lockdowns spanning for about the next month, though the restrictions stopped short of the draconian measures announced earlier on during the pandemic. In the US, the seven-day average of daily new cases rose to a record 70,000 as of yesterday, according to data compiled by the Washington Post.

On the vaccine front, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nations top infectious-disease expert, said he believed it would take until at least January for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to authorize a COVID-19 vaccine. There are five companies (Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Moderna (MRNA), Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (ELY), and BioNTech (BNTX)) in the final stages of study for a coronavirus vaccine, with Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc. having fully enrolled their trials, Fauci said.

Some analysts consider the recent pull-back in the stock market a healthy inevitability, given the strong rally that took many stocks to all-time highs earlier in the Month. Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network, said in a note to clients, Markets have been baking in a lot of optimism: that the pandemic was under control, that the economy was healing, and that things would be back to something approaching normal in 2021. Those assumptions were always optimistic, though, and what we are seeing now is a reality-based repricing. As such, this drop is both necessary and healthy. Markets should reflect the most likely future path, not the most optimistic, and that is where we are headed.

Remarkably, despite many individual companies pulling back steeply today, the three major indexes finished the day positive, driven by gains in financial stocks and stability in mega-caps. Growth stocks and more speculative plays have been hit hard by a combination of inflationary fears and recent suggestions by monetary officials that the interest rate should be raised. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.81%, less than 1% below its record high. The Dow Jones (DIA) recorded a new intraday record while the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.76%. Market participants continue to monitor commentary from monetary officials, ongoing earnings season, and new economic data, particularly the April Jobs Report set for release tomorrow morning.

After reclaiming the leadership in April as the best performing sector in the SPY, so far in May we have seen investors rotate out of big tech stocks and into financial stocks, with many big banks pushing all-time highs today. Market participants are worried that a suggested raise in interest would affect the already stretched valuation of some companies. Given the rally the market saw in April, some analysts are worried that positive catalysts for equities are getting harder to achieve and may be running out. The economy in the US is recovering faster than initially predicted by analysts, with this earnings season seeing 86% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 that have reported earnings  beat estimates, according to data from FactSet. 

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested that interest rates may need to rise in the near-term to prevent the economy from overheating, with the recent economic data and corporate earnings showing economic activity recovering much faster than expected as effective distribution of the vaccine in the US allows states to gradually reopen. Yellen said, It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them."" In later remarks, she added that raising rates was not something she was predicting or recommending and that the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Reserve. She said, Let me be clear, thats not something Im predicting or recommending. If anybody appreciates the independence of the Fed, I think that person is me.

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating Marchs gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

**Highlights**

* Weekly unemployment claims fell to 498,000 last weeka new low since the Covid-19 pandemic began more than a year ago. The four-week average of initial claims is also at the lowest point since the pandemic began. Read more [here](https://www.wsj.com/articles/weekly-jobless-claims-coronavirus-05-06-2021-11620247798).
* The Bank of England upped their growth estimates for the economy of the UK, anticipating GDP will grow 7.25% in the country, up from its forecast for 5% growth in February. The BOE also now sees inflation averaging 2.5% in 2021, up from its prior forecast for 2%, but said the rise in price pressures will likely be ""temporary."" 
* NIO announced the company will expand into Norway, with the groups first service and delivery center set to open in the capital Oslo in September.
* A lot of stocks pulled back despite posting better than expected earnings. The market is very narrow right now, with gains concentrated in the financials, energy, and mega-caps.
* IBM introduced what it says is the world's first 2-nanometer chip making technology. The technology could be as much as 45% faster than the mainstream 7-nanometer chips in many of today's laptops and phones and up to 75% more power efficient, the company said.

Stocks largely gained today in another volatile session, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) once again powering to new intraday highs, the third time this week for the SPY. The major indexes continue to be driven higher by continued strength in mega-cap tech stocks. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small caps, continued its streak of underperformance, trading 1.65% lower today at the time of writing. Market participants continue to digest new inflationary data, Q2 earnings season, and Jerome Powells testimony before Congress.

This week, the market is starting to experience signs of volatility, with the SPY opening the session firmly in the green before falling until about the middle of the session before recovering to close the day green. It seems to me that recent reports about inflationary data have injected some uncertainty into the market. The Labor Departments June Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from Mays 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last years pandemic-era lows.

Today, a report by the Labor Department showed that the Producer Price Index (PPI), which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 1% in June, accelerating to 7.3% rise year-on-year, while still reflecting base effects. Core PPI rse 5.5%. This is the fastest rate of increase since 2009.

While the CPI and PPI prints are not ideal, the markets somewhat muted reaction (though there was a little volatility) seems to confirm that market participants are increasingly pricing in higher-than-expected inflationary data and are buying into the Federal Reserves argument that current pressures are transitory and due to pandemic-related disruptions. Moreover, it is very important to consider that current inflationary data is calculated on a year-on-year basis, so base effects are very much inflating the current numbers. In other words, inflationary readings are high because they are being measured using numbers from June 2020 when prices across the board collapsed as lockdowns and social distancing policies were implemented across the world. As I have said many times in the past, I am personally not yet worried about current inflationary pressures translating into a prolonged cycle of higher prices, though one always has to acknowledge the risks in the market and be prepared to act.

In other news, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave  his semi-annual monetary policy to Congress, where once again, he basically said the same thing he has been saying for months. Powell said inflation will likely remain elevated in the coming months before moderating and that the US economy was still a ways off from reaching the threshold of substantial further progress that would trigger the Central Bank to roll-back pandemic-era policies. In short, Powell basically said while he expects higher inflation prints in the coming months, pressures are transitory and due to pandemic era disruptions and the Feds goal for economic recovery have not been met. [Here is Powells complete testimony, but here are two of his most important quotes.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20210714a.htm)

**On the labor market:** Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, but there is still a long way to go. Labor demand appears to be very strong; job openings are at a record high, hiring is robust, and many workers are leaving their current jobs to search for better ones. Indeed, employers added 1.7 million workers from April through June. However, the unemployment rate remained elevated in June at 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Job gains should be strong in coming months as public health conditions continue to improve and as some of the other pandemic-related factors currently weighing them down diminish.

**On inflation:** Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Inflation is being temporarily boosted by base effects, as the sharp pandemic-related price declines from last spring drop out of the 12-month calculation. In addition, strong demand in sectors where production bottlenecks or other supply constraints have limited production has led to especially rapid price increases for some goods and services, which should partially reverse as the effects of the bottlenecks unwind. Prices for services that were hard hit by the pandemic have also jumped in recent months as demand for these services has surged with the reopening of the economy.

**Highlights**

* Big banks continued to underperform today, with investors not impressed despite banks posting very strong earning reports. . JP Morgan, which is often considered a bellwether for the US economy given its sheer size, reported great results, driven in part by the release of $3 billion the bank had set aside to protect against potential losses from default loans during the pandemic, a sign that consumers held up better than the bank expected. JPM recorded revenues of $31.4 billion and profits of $11.948 billion, a staggering improvement from profits of $4.687 billion a year ago. One downside from the earnings report is a sharp reduction in revenues produced from trading, which is not surprising given the insane run by the market in 2020.
* Airline stocks initially gapped up in the morning after American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Airlines (DAL) offered upbeat outlooks for the second half of 2021, citing increasing consumer demand as the US continues to reopen. However, stocks were unable to hold onto their gains and largely finished negative.
* Twitter (TWTR) announced it was discontinuing its disappearing Fleets feature after failure to win traction with users.
* According to Facebook (FB), the company is pledging $1 billion to support content creators on its platforms through the end of 2022. Content creators will receive a monthly bonus if they hit milestones for earnings Stars, a form of digital tipping that fans can use to pay their favorite creators during live-streamed videos. Instagram's bonus programs will include incentives to use Reels, its copycat TikTok feature that showcases short-form video clips. Creators will earn money based on how their Reels videos perform, the company said.
* Microsoft (MSFT) is betting hybrid work will provide an opening to make its Windows operating system more widespread, launching a new service aimed at getting users of Apple (AAPL) and Android products to use the software. Windows 365, the company said, will be accessible on any device running any operating system that has a web browser, such as Apple Mac computers, iPhones and iPads, or those running Android software made by Alphabet (GOOGL)

Stocks broadly fell today as market participants continued digesting Q2 earning reports, reassurances from the Federal Reserve that current inflationary pressures is temporary and new economic reports that suggest a slowdown in the global growth rate. After recording several new intraday highs this week, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) slipped, closing 0.34% and 0.7% down respectively. The Russell 2000 (IWM) fell for the third straight day this week, closing 0.54% down.

Markets seem to have become jittery following the release of the June Consumer and Producer Price Index (CPI &amp; PPI). (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from Mays 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008.

In other news, new economic data coming out of China, the first country to experience and begin recovering from the virus, is showing a marked slowdown in economic growth. The world's second largest economy expanded at a 7.9% rate in the second quarter from a year ago, according to the National Bureau of Statistics, missing consensus estimates for an 8.0% rise and decelerating sharply from the first quarter's 18.3% increase. In response, the Peoples Bank of China signalled it was cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, a move that suggests the economic recovery in China may be slowing down. The Peoples Bank of China (PBOC) will reduce the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage point for most banks, according to a [statement](http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/4287599/index.html) published Friday. That will unleash about 1 trillion yuan ($154 billion) of long-term liquidity into the economy and will be effective on July 15, the central bank said. The reduction was signaled earlier this week, when the State Council, Chinas equivalent of a cabinet, hinted the central bank would make more liquidity available to banks so they could lend to smaller firms hurt by rising costs. The timing and magnitude of the move, coming a week before second-quarter growth data, suggests worries about the economys outlook and was a decisive shift away from policy tightening, which most, if not all, recovering economies are pursuing.  Just to put into more familiar terms, this would be like if the Federal Reserve suddenly turned around and said rather than discussing tapering quantitative easing, it would instead propose pumping more money into the economy.

In good news, the Weekly Unemployment Report showed new jobless claims fall to pandemic-era lows. 

* **Initial jobless claims, week ended July 10:** 360,000 vs. 350,000 expected and a revised 386,000 during prior week 
* **Continuing claims, week ended July 3:** 3.241 million vs. 3.300 million expected and a revised 3.367 million during prior week

**Highlights** 

* Import prices were up 1% in June over May, adding to a 1.4% increase the month prior. This marks the eighth straight month import prices have risen and brings the annual price increase to 11.2%
* Netflix (NFLX) has announced it plans to eventually stream video games on its platform and hired a former Electronic Arts (EA) executive to lead the push. 
* As earnings season continues, big bank stocks continue falling despite, in most cases, posting great earnings. 
* Square (SQ) announced it has acquired Crew, and app that enables real-time access to communicate with frontline hourly workers and assist with scheduling and other managerial services.

At around 1 p.m. ET, the Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) reported that it identified the first confirmed case of the new coronavirus Omicron variant in the United States. Dr. Anthony Fauci told reporters the person was a traveler who returned from South Africa on Nov. 22 and tested positive on Nov. 29. Fauci said the person was vaccinated but had not received a booster shot and was experiencing mild symptoms. On November 26, [President Bidens administration announced it was instituting a travel ban on South Africa ](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/11/26/a-proclamation-on-suspension-of-entry-as-immigrants-and-nonimmigrants-of-certain-additional-persons-who-pose-a-risk-of-transmitting-coronavirus-disease-2019/)and other African nations in an effort to curb the spread. The US now joins about two dozen countries that have detected the coronavirus Omicron virus. The Omicron variant was first detected in South Africa on November 24.

vaccine makers released new, less optimistic commentary regarding how effective existing vaccines are against the new Omicron variant. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said their current vaccine would likely see a material drop in effectiveness against the Omicron variant. 

He said, There is no world, I think, where \[the effectiveness\] is the same level	we had with \[the\] Delta \[variant\]. I think its going to be a material drop. I just dont know how much because we need to wait for the data. But all the scientists Ive talked to	.	.	. are like, This is not going to be good.

[https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f](https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f)

Both Pfizer and Moderna have said they were collecting data on the Omicron variant and that more definitive information would be available in the coming weeks. Researchers have not yet determined whether the new variant is more easily transmitted, or responsible for more severe illness, than previous versions of the virus.

J. Pows latest remarks before the Senate Banking Committee spooked the markets, after he said he would back off from using the word transitory to describe rising inflation. This is very notable because the Central bank has been using the T-word since the beginning of the year, when it warned that steep differences in year-over-year comparisons and supply-chain bottlenecks would lead to elevated inflation. 

Powell said, We tend to use \[the word transitory\] to mean that it wont leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation. I think its probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean.

Moreover, Powell suggested the Central Bank was considering completing its asset purchase taper a few months sooner than previously telegraphed. Market participants expected a more supportive stance, especially with the new COVID variant, but instead Powell suggested his priority was now on curbing higher than expected inflation. 

Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment, said Chairman Powells commentary course-corrected the view on inflation and the potential need for quicker policy adjustment. The reality is hotter inflation coupled with a strong economic backdrop could end the Feds bond buying program as early as the first quarter of next year. Ultimately, the transitory view on inflation has officially come to an end as Powells comments reinforced the notion that elevated prices are likely to persist well into next year. With potential changes in policy on the horizon, market participants should expect additional market volatility in this uncharted territory.""

***Please note:*** *I've seen a lot of questions surrounding the analyst price target upgrades that I post, so I just wanted to clear some things up and explain my reasoning behind including them.*

*I frequently get asked if I think analyst price target predictions are ""accurate"" or if I expect a stock I mention to hit the price predicted.* ***The answer to both these questions is NO.*** 

*I really don't put much, if any importance, on the actual numbers predicted by an analyst. They are just a meter to gauge how bullish or bearish they are. My purpose in including price target upgrades is to find trends in analyst thinking. In other words, if I see a bunch of different, well-known analysts all giving bullish target increases on a stock, I'll start doing research on a stock to see why they are so bullish. I have found quite a few profitable trades in this manner.*

***In short, the purpose of the price target upgrades is idea generation. Keep an eye out if you start seeing the same stock receiving bullish target increases by different analysts.***

Stocks were mixed, but mostly positive today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) recording a fresh intraday high and the Dow Jones (DIA) nicely continuing its recovery after falling last week, driven higher by a boost in bank stocks across the board after the Fed removed all pandemic-era restrictions on capital distributions. The Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly after several days of reaching new all-time highs. The core personal consumption expenditures, which serves as the Feds preferred gauge for inflation was released but did not adversely affect the market, another signal the market is prepared to stomach higher than usual inflationary readings as the economy continues to recover. 

The core PCE index measures the changes in prices paid by consumers for goods and services, minus volatile food and energy prices, which are staples and therefore not considered in the equation. The report registered a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, in-line with Wall Street estimates and marking the fastest jump since 1992. However, it is important to note that the report is still reflecting base effects as prices rebound from the pandemic-induced collapse last year. 

Yesterday, the Federal Reserve released the results of its stress test on US banks, an annual test instituted after the 2008 financial crisis meant to determine the financial health of lenders during an extreme hypothetical financial crisis (not unlike what was experienced last year).The test used a hypothetical severely adverse scenario where the U.S. economy saw GDP shrink by 4%, the unemployment rate rise to 10.75%, and the stock market contract by 55%. In the end, the test showed the 23 largest banks could withstand $474 billion in losses from loans and other positions and still emerge with more than double the minimum required capital.

The results of this stress test are extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Given the clean bill of health, these restrictions have now been fully lifted, paving the way for banks across the board to raise dividends and ramp up stock buyback programs. To put in extent how much money this is, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters.

In other news, President Joe Biden announced he had reached an infrastructure agreement with a bipartisan group of senators, which catalyzed a jump in industrial stocks that had been lagging the last few weeks. The deal, which would cost $1.2 trillion over the next five years, commits  $312 billion toward traditional infrastructure priorities such as roads, bridges, public transit, airports and waterways. The bulk of the remainder will be invested in water, broadband and power grid restoration, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House. 

Gabriela Santos, global market strategist at JP Morgan said, The way we're thinking about it is, it has the positive side of the deal in terms of the equity market perspective: More spending on physical infrastructure, electric vehicles, 5G and broadband, without the tax increases which would have been a negative from the equity market perspective. This is certainly a positive especially for the more domestic, cyclical-heavy parts of the market, as well as parts of technology like semiconductors, which are more related to the 5G and the green theme."" 

**Highlights**

* Yesterday, ARK Investment Manager Cathie Wood and Twitter and Square (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey have been named as co-hosts of The ¿ Word, a new initiative designed to bring business and technology leaders together to discuss how institutions can use digital currencies. Today, through Twitter (TWTR) Jack directly asked Elon to speak at the conference, which he accepted. Will be interesting to see what happens. 
* Panasonic, Teslas (TSLA) leading battery supplier, announced it has sold its entire stake in TSLA stock for roughly $3.6 billion. There is no word as to why they did this but Panasonic assured the move would not affect its supply of batteries. Years ago, Panasonic made a $1.6 billion bet on building a joint battery factory with Tesla in Nevada called the Gigafactory. It caused years of losses at Panasonic before the company said this year it was finally turning a quarterly profit.

Stocks mostly drifted lower to hover below record levels, as market participants further digested yesterdays US retail sales report and new corporate earning results from major retailers, which provide further data into consumer spending patterns amid supply-chain disruptions. 

**Here are some key numbers for today**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -0.25%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): +0.05%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.58%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -1.27%
* Apple (AAPL): +1.75%
* Target (TGT): -4.73%

The Department of Commerce released their monthly Retail Sales Report, which showed better than expected consumer spending trends as the holiday season, by far the busiest in the year, continues to play out. Here are the numbers

* Retail Sales: 1.7% increase vs 1.4% expected
* Core Retail Sales: +1.6%
* Manufacturing Production: +1.2%

The solid report suggests that high inflation is not dampening consumer spending. Rising household wealth, thanks to a strong stock market, house prices, and rising wages appear to be cushioning consumers against the highest annual pace of inflation in roughly thirty years. 

Steven Wieting, Citigroups Global Wealth Chief Investment Strategist said, The markets generally are looking at it \[the pace of inflation\], benignly - they are not discounting some longer-term inflation of more than 2.5%. You can see this in the pricing out on the yield curve of Treasuries. You can see this in the composition of the market with growth stocks not really being beaten down by any concerns about some lurch higher, tightening of monetary policy. We think that story is largely correct  its benign for markets. It doesnt mean we get to repeat the returns from the past year, however.

Today, Target (TGT) and Lowes (LOW), two major retailers in the US, both reported better than expected earnings. This comes on the heels of both Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) both reporting strong earnings results earlier in the week. Here are the numbers (second number were analyst expectation):

**Target (TGT)**: With a strong inventory position heading into the peak of the holiday season, our team and our business are ready to serve our guests and poised to deliver continued, strong growth, through the holiday season and beyond,"" said Target Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell in a statement. 

* Revenue: $25.7 billion vs. $24.20 billion
* Comparable Store Sales: +12.7% vs. +8.3%
* Gross Margin: 28% vs. 29.80%
* Operating Margin: 7.8% vs. 7.68%
* Diluted EPS: $3.03 vs. $2.84

**Lowes (LOW):** Our momentum continued this quarter, with U.S. sales comps up nearly 34% on a two-year basis, as our Total Home strategy is resonating with the Pro and DIY customer alike. In the quarter, we drove over 16% growth in Pro and 25% on Lowes.com. We also delivered operating margin expansion by driving productivity through disciplined operational execution and cost management, said Lowe Chairman, President, and CEO Marvin Ellisoln. 

* Revenue: $22.92 billion vs. $22.06 billion 
* Earnings per share: $2.73 vs. $2.36
* $1.90 billion in profits vs $692 million Q3 2020
* Same Store Sales: +2.2% vs -1.5%

**Highlights**

* The party seems over& after a blockbuster IPO, shares of EV startup Rivian (RIVN), which had a market cap of $150 billion on essentially 0 revenue, fell 15% today. In my humble opinion, Id get out if I had profits (not playing this at all). Shares of Lucid Motors (LCID) were also down roughly 5% in sympathy
* CME Group (CME) the world's largest financial derivatives exchange in the world, trading everything from agricultural products, currencies, energy, interest rates, metals, stock indexes to digital currency futures, announced it was planning to move core trading systems Google Clouds, a massive move in financial markets. Until very recently, it was assumed that cloud computing was ill suited for high frequency trading, forcing these companies to build and develop complicated systems geared for time sensitive markets. If this works, it could reduce the cost of operations by a lot. 
* Fisker (FSR), another EV startup in the market, announced an electric SUV with higher driving range than Teslas (TSLA) Model Y. Fisker announced the OCean Ultra SUV, which is planned to begin production next November, has a range of 340 miles and costs $50,000 compared to 300 miles and a cost of $60,000 with the Model Y
* Apple said Wednesday that it has created a self-service repair program that would allow customers to repair their own devices using genuine Apple parts and tools. The iPhone and Mac maker said Self Service Repair would begin in early 2022 with a focus on the most common serviced modules, including phone display, battery and camera, with additional repair options to be added later in the year. The right to repair has been a big controversy surrounding technology sold by companies. 
* According to recent filings, Elon Musk is roughly halfway done with his pledge to sell 10% of his stake in Tesla (TSLA). You can see it here [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/insider-activity](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/insider-activity)
* Waymo, which is a subsidiary of Googles parent company Alphabet, said on Wednesday it is expanding its partnership with United Parcel Service (UPS) to move freight using autonomous trucks between two of the parcel delivery company's Texas facilities during the holiday season. This comes amid a shortage of delivery drivers in the US.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, October 6, 2021**

Stocks opened the session lower, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) falling as much as 1.2% early before turning positive in yet another volatile session after a report that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said his party would approve an extension of the government debt ceiling until at least December. Market participants collectively gave a massive sigh of relief now that we arent staring down the barrel of a default. You can never count on Congress in the US, but I did say I thought it was very unlikely that the Senate was going to let the American economy implode by choice. In my humble opinion, I think the worse is behind us and look forward to buying up the first -5% and -8%  dip in the SPY and Nasdaq (QQQ) all year, though I do expect some choppiness moving forward. 

In recent weeks, market participants have been anxiously monitoring developments out of Washington DC, as Congressional lawmakers debated raising the debt ceiling and avoiding an absolute catastrophe if the US were to default on its debt, something that has never (and hopefully will never) happen. Put bluntly, a debt default would plunge the economy into a long-lasting recession, GDP growth would slide and millions would lose their jobs. According to a report by Moodys Analytics, one of the three big along with Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch Group, approximately 6 million jobs would be lost and the unemployment would spike dramatically, US GDP would decline, and there would be an irrevocable stain on the faith and strength of US financial markets. Internationally, the United States will have for the first time undermined the full faith and credit of its own currency -- a blow to our standing in the world and a boon for our adversaries such as China who are arguing to the world that the US is on the decline

The report goes on to say, Global financial markets and the economy would be upended, and even if resolved quickly, Americans would pay for this default for generations, as global investors would rightly believe that the federal governments finances have been politicized and that a time may come when they would not be paid what they are owed when owed it. To compensate for this risk, they will demand higher interest rates on the Treasury bonds they purchase. That will exacerbate our daunting long-term fiscal challenges and be a lasting corrosive on the economy, significantly diminishing it.

Moreover, despite valid concerns surrounding inflation, recent economic data has been very upbeat recently, a sign that despite there being many obstacles remaining, the US economy continues to recover from the pandemic-induced recession. Durable goods, retail sales, and purchasing managers index-tracking activity across US manufacturing have all recently topped expectations. However, prices for those goods remain elevated compared to earlier periods due to ongoing supply-chain disruptions, shortages in key materials, and recently, rolling blackouts in China that have forced the closure of crucial factories ahead of the busiest shopping season of the year.

* Tesla (TSLA) will have to pay $130 in punitive damages and $7 million to the victim after a jury found the automaker guilty of failing to take appropriate steps to prevent race-based harassment of factory workers. Punitive damages are designed to punish and to deter future unlawful conduct, while compensatory damages are intended to pay victims for their actual losses.
* General Motors (GM) set a very ambitious financial target, telling investors it plans to more than double revenue by 203 with an influx of electric-models.
* Facebook Inc has slowed down the rollout of new products in recent days, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, as the company faces a barrage of criticism from all directions.

"89","2021-03-11",1615498911,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, March 11, 2021. Please enjoy!","Stocks continued advancing on Thursday, with the Dow Jones (DIA) and the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) setting fresh intraday records. Market participants are encouraged after President Biden signed into law a new coronavirus relief package. Treasury yields also steadied at 1.525% at the time of writing. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 2.3% up, the SPY closed 1% up, and the Dow closed 0.62% up.

After months of negotiation, President Biden signed into law a new $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package after the bill passed in both houses of Congress by party-line votes. The bill includes provisions like $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans, $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits through early September, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government aid. The bill comes exactly one year following the World Health Organization's formal designation of the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. 

Ian Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote of the bill The most immediate impact in the macroeconomic data will be in retail sales numbers, where some of the $410 billion in direct payments will appear in both the March and  especially  April reports.

The sharp contrast between the performance of the Dow and the Nasdaq in recent weeks underscores market participants increasing rotation out of high-flying tech stocks that led the markets higher in 2020 into stocks that are poised to directly benefit from the impending economic reopening. The cyclical energy and financials sectors have also been leading gains in the S&amp;P 500, extending a run of outperformance against tech and growth shares.

The [Labor Department's Consumer Price Index (CPI)](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm) on Tuesday showed core consumer prices increased less than expected in February.{prices paid by consumers rose only 1.3% in February over last year, coming in below the 1.4% increase expected and slowing from the prior month. While it may not seem like a lot, the report helps quell fears that as economic activity increased and more stimulus was unleashed into the economy, inflationary pressures would begin to materialize. This also suggests the Federal Reserve can maintain its accommodative monetary policy and avoid rising interest rates for the foreseeable future.

* Antitrust regulators in China are mulling the imposition of a fine of over $975 million on Alibaba, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter.
* Shares of General Electric Co. took another dive Thursday, putting them on track to suffer the biggest decline in more than 11 months, as analysts gave a mixed review of the companys Analyst Day and GECAS deal.

Stocks opened todays session higher before paring some gains ahead of an extremely busy week, with market participants closely monitoring the results of the US presidential election, a meeting of the Federal Reserve, and the October jobs report, and rising coronavirus numbers in the US and Europe.

After an extremely choppy day, the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.22% up, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 1.11% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the best, finishing 1.56% up.

On Tuesday is the US presidential election between incumbent Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. Needless to say, given the political divide, the coronavirus pandemic, and social unrest that exists in the United States right now, the outcome of this election will be extremely significant. According to a study done by Edward Jones, since 1932, the stock market has dipped 64% percent of the time the day after a presidential election. This likely reflects anxiety about the future if a large cohort of the population is unhappy with the election result. Regardless of the election result,  it's likely a large section of the population will be unhappy. Moreover, given the surge of early and mail-in ballots due to the pandemic, the possibility exists that the outcome may not be clear after Tuesday. This scenario would certainly cause a massive spike in volatility and uncertainty in the markets. According to the US Elections Project at the University of Florida, as of Friday of last week, around 85 million individuals have cast their ballots, over half of the total turnout in 2016. If this pace picks up, this election could have the highest voter participation rate in over 100 years.

Regardless of the outcome, the election will have a number of consequences for Corporate America. For example, a change in the political control in either the Senate or the White House (which are Republican-controlled right now) could potentially alter corporate tax rates, increase or decrease regulation in some industries, affect trade relations with other countries, and changes in capital gains tax, which is important for market participants. Moreover, the outcome of the election will likely influence the timing and size of much-needed additional fiscal stimulus 

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is set to hold the first of its two-day rate-setting meeting the day after Election Day, with the twelve FOMC meeting Wednesday and monetary policy statement and press conference from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday. Going off previous meetings, the Fed is virtually guaranteed to keep interest rates, near zero. After their last meeting in September, the Fed signaled that it would maintain interest rates are current levels until at least 2023. Throughout these meetings, FOMC members, including Powell, have increasingly escalated their calls for further fiscal stimulus to complement the Feds monetary support. In early October, Powell said, too little support would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardships for households and businesses.

On Friday, the Department of Labor is set to release the October job report, a crucial piece of data to understand the state of the labor market and gauge the pace of recovery. According to Bloomberg consensus data, non-farm payrolls are expected to increase by around 600,000. While this estimate would the sixth month of net payroll gains, it would also be the four, straight month of deceleration, indicating the pace of recovery is slowing. The unemployment rate is also predicted to tick lower, from 7.9% to 7.6%. However, worryingly, there appears to be a trend towards long-term unemployment for many Americans. The number of individuals filing continuing claims, people filing for unemployment benefits who have already filed an initial claim, has continued to increase the past several weeks. This means that people who lost their job due to the pandemic are having an increasing harder time finding new employment quickly.

The US just set a new record for the highest seven-day average of daily new cases: 81,336 as of Sunday. That's the first time the number has ever topped 80,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. new cases are far exceeding new testing. Over the past week, new cases have increased 18%, according to Johns Hopkins. But the number of new tests performed has increased only 4.29%, according to the Covid Tracking Project. 

Last week, Europe recorded around 1.5 million new cases of coronavirus, a new record, according to data from Johns Hopkins. Trends are worrying across the continent now, including in countries such as Greece and the Czech Republic, where infection rates had been low until recently. Measures are tightening up everywhere. England, in response to the surge, announced a nationwide lockdown for at least the next four weeks.

**Highlights**

* Apple (AAPL) announced on Monday an event for Nov. 10 where its expected to announce new Macs that are powered by their own chips powered by ARM processors, instead of the Intel chips it had been using.

* Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO announced its October deliveries, and the number has shares on the move, again. NIO delivered 5,055 vehicles in October, doubling from a year ago.

Stocks traded mostly sideways today, managing to mostly hold on to recent gains, despite new data on consumer confidence coming in below expectations. After the volatility experienced in the first few weeks of May, recent price action has been more encouraging to me. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.2% down, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.15% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.22% down. 

Today, the Conference Board (a non-profit research organization), released their April Consumer Confidence index which showed sentiment falling steeper than expected. The report showed the consumer confidence index dipped to 117.2 in May from 117.5 in April. However, on the positive side, April's reading was the highest since February 2020, before the start of Covid-19 lockdowns. Economists expected consumer confidence to rise to 119.5. 

A separate report by Standard &amp; Poors said that its S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index posted an annual gain of 13.2% in March up from 12% in February and marking 10-straight months of acceleration in home prices. The results far outpaced analysts expectations of a 12.5% annual gain, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. According to a recent Reuters poll, U.S. house prices are forecast to outpace GDP growth and consumer inflation  rising at a blistering pace to average 10.6% this year, almost double the 5.7% predicted in February. With demand rising faster than supply, it is not surprising to see home prices surging forward, with economists expecting the growth to taper once supply rises to meet demand. Total housing inventory at the end of April was 1.16 million units, down 20.5% from one year ago  the lowest level since NAR started tracking homes for sale in 2011. Inventory, however, was up 10.5% from March, an indication that homebuilding is picking up.

Today, members of the Federal Open Markets Committee reiterated their stance that the Fed was not yet worried about rising prices forcing the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be mostly temporary and that the Fed was not quite there yet when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.

* The Washington DCs Attorney General filed an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon.com Inc. on Tuesday, alleging the company blocks sellers on its marketplace from offering lower prices elsewhere to stymie competition
* Reddit-stocks like Gamestop (GME) and AMC are once again on the move higher.
* The court case between Epic Games and Apple (AAPL) s expected to end this week as both sides prepare closing arguments. As a reminder, Epic Games is accusing Apple of antitrust behavior by taking a 30% commission from sales in the app store and blocking companies from using third-party payment options. Apple says it prevents third-party software to ensure consumer protection and the commission is in-line with other app-store developers, like Alphabet. The result of this case will have very wide ranging implications.

Stocks were on a run today, climbing steadily higher all the way into close, fueled by hope stemming from President Trumps tweets on the push to approve $1,200 checks and support for Airlines.

The SPY finished up 1.73%, the QQQ up 1.8%, and the DIA up 1.85%. Additionally the small cap IWM is up 2.18% for the day, and the Biotech etf IBB closed up 2.22%.

Yesterday in the early afternoon, Trump announced that he would stop all Stimulus talks until after the election. The markets saw a very significant slide off, only recouping a bit of the losses by the close. However, later in the day, going back on his word he made two significant tweets which helped to push the markets higher today. If I am sent a Stand Alone Bill for Stimulus Checks ($1,200), they will go out to our great people IMMEDIATELY. I am ready to sign right now. Are you listening Nancy? and the second was about the airlines The House &amp; Senate should IMMEDIATELY Approve 25 Billion Dollars for Airline Payroll Support, &amp; 135 Billion Dollars for Paycheck Protection Program for Small Business. Both of these will be fully paid for with unused funds from the Cares Act. Have this money. I will sign now!

During today, Speaker Pelosi conducted an interview on ABCs The View where she signaled willingness to keep discussions open, but disparaged the idea of stand-alone bills. She continues to support the idea that a one comprehensive package in the order of $2 Trillion must be passed in whole. House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth said We dont have time to save the economy piece by piece. As Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told us, we need to act now and act big.

It is worth noting Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, and Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin have constantly been advocating that with all the Fed has done, still more direct stimulus from Congress is needed to aid with the recovery. Many feel it is unfortunate to see that the stimulus has become a ground to push political agendas, while the ones who pay the price are the regular American citizens.

Tonight there will be a vice presidential debate between Kamala Harris, and current VP Mike Pence. According to a report published by Marketwatch the stakes will be high as ""Vice President Pence must put in a strong performance against the democratic nominee, Sen Kamala Harris of California, to turn the electorate's attention away from the first presidential debate and a barrage of negative news coverage related to Trump's recent COVID-19 diagnosis and subsequent hospitalization"".

On other fronts, hotspots for Coronavirus are picking up, with the latest restrictions coming from New York. The rule will come into effect on Friday and will affect businesses, houses of worships and schools. Boston has also delayed the reopening of schools for a week. India is closing in on the US to become the country with most infections, adding 78k new cases, more than double of the US, to total 6.8M vs the 7.7M total cases in the US.

Vaccine developments continue to move forward with the White House and FDA finally on agreement on the guidelines to approve for Emergency use. Also, During the John Hopkins University Vaccine Symposium, Operation Warp Speed Chief says within next month or two ""We feel comfortable"" that we will have one or two efficacious candidates to deliver doses to 30M people by Nov or Dec 2020 as per reports on the event by Benzinga. The story on Trumps recovery is that he has been treated with a cocktail with treatments from GILD and REGN and is currently recuperating presenting mild to no symptoms according to a report by CNBC.

Volatility in the stock market continues, with the three major indexes, particularly the Nasdaq (QQQ), reversing hard after suffering one of its worst days all year, with Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) leading the charge. Market participants continue to closely monitor developments out of Washington and wait for upcoming economic and earnings data to gauge concerns over supply chain disruptions and inflation. Tech stocks once again came under pressure as the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield continues to rise. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 1.04% higher, the Nasdaq closed 1.35% higher and the Dow Jones (DIA) closing 0.92% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, underperformed, closing just 0.35% higher.

Weve seen previous episodes of rising rates, both earlier this year as well as when the Fed first announced intentions to begin tapering quantitative easing in the not too distant future. Each of these episodes caused a hiccup but didnt derail the broader bull market. According to Edward Jones, yields went from below 1% to 1.75% during the first three months of this year, a period that included pullbacks in the S&amp;P 500 of 3.7% for four days and 4.2% for 12 days. However, during that entire three-month stretch in which rates were rising, the stock market rose more than 7%.  In this current spate, 10-year rates have jumped from 1.30% on September 15 to as high as 1.54% last week, reflecting a renewed concern over inflation pressures and reduced Fed stimulus expectations

Stocks are struggling to regain their footing after the September selloff, given that many of the concerns that sparked last months drop remain. Congressional lawmakers have yet to come to an agreement on a solution to raise the debt limit to prevent a potential government default sometime mid-October. Failure to do so would be catastrophic for the US economy.  As a reminder, Congress successfully averted a government shutdown last week. The House approved a bill late on Wednesday suspending the debt limit through December 2022. The Senate could vote on it as early as this week Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, but Republicans are expected to block it again as they have twice before. This is an evolving situation. In my humble opinion, I think the Republicans are playing political games with the debt ceiling and will pass it last minute, similar to the spending bill to avoid the government shutdown.

Looking ahead, the September Jobs Report will be released later this week. Market participants are hoping to see payroll gains accelerate after a shockingly disappointing August report, which shoed just 235,000 new payrolls gains versus more than 700,000 expected. Consensus economists anticipate that 475,000 payrolls returned in September, and that the unemployment rate fell to 5.1% or the lowest since March 2020.

**Highlights**

* Today, Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen gave testimony before the Senate exposing FBs business practices and calling for more stringent regulation of the company.
* The price of ... topped $50k again and up 25% this week
* Three top US hedge funds, Man Group, Elliot Management, Marshall Wace, and Soros Fund Management, who combined manage roughly $200b in assets, have warned that Chinese businesses have become uninvestable amid the anti-monopoly scandal, power shortages and Evergrande situation. I agree and personally divested all my holdings in Chinese stocks months ago, some at a loss. Just my opinion.
* National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA), South Africas largest metalworkers union with over 155,000 members, said it was launching an indefinite strike to press for wage increases. This action could block critical supplies for car manufacturing, threatening to further strain a supply chain already stretched thin.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, September 16, 2021**

Stocks finished mixed in a volatile session after getting a boost following the release of new economic data that showed retail sales for the month of August coming in stronger-than-expected, suggesting that consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP, held up despite rising coronavirus Delta variant concerns. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) and Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed the day with a gain of 0.07% and 0.08% respectively. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell 0.17% and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell 0.17% and 0.19% down respectively. Jobless claims also came in near a pandemic-era low. 

With the coronavirus Delta variant fanning fears of a slowdown in growth in the US and China, market participants have been carefully weighing incoming economic data. In the US, August retail sales showed an unexpected rise despite the latest surge of coronavirus Delta variant cases. The Commerce Department's August retail sales report showed overall sales rose by 0.7% on the month after a downwardly revised 1.8% drop in July. Consensus economists were looking for a 0.7% drop. 

A few days ago, Chinas retail sales report showed a dramatic slowdown in growth as the country battles rising coronavirus cases and seasonal floodings, with output and sales reaching a one-year low. Consumer spending grew 2.5% in the month of August, a sharp deceleration from the 8.5% growth in July and missing estimates of 7% growth. Industrial production rose 5.3% in August from a year earlier, narrowing from an increase of 6.4% in July and marking the weakest pace since July 2020, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. Output growth missed the 5.8% increase tipped by analysts.

In a new weekly report by Factset, consensus analysts are still looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings growth of nearly 28% for the third quarter. While a deceleration from the more than 80% growth rate posted in the second quarter of this year, that would still mark the third-highest year-over-year increase in earnings for the index since 2010. Third-quarter earnings reporting season is set to pick up next month. 

**Highlights**

* Lucids (LCID) luxury sedan has received a government certification for a range of 520 miles. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said its the longest range EV rated so far. For comparisons, Teslas Model S was rated for a range of 405 miles, though it is a lot cheaper.

The Nasdaq 100 index is a modified market-capitalization index. Market valuation is the largest factor, but with methodology to limit overconcentration.

The seven-largest companies in the Nasdaq 100 account for 55% of the index. It seems likely that this combined weighting will be reduced. It's also likely that there may be notable weighting shifts within these seven giants.

The current weights show that market capitalization is the dominant factor, but it's not the only one.

Microsoft stock has the largest weight, at 12.9%, as of July 7. Apple stock has a 12.5% weight, despite having a $2.999 trillion market cap vs. Microsoft's $2.51 trillion.

Google stock has a 7.4% weighting with the GOOGL and GOOG share classes combined.

Nvidia stock has vaulted to a 7% Nasdaq 100 weighting, thanks to its $1.05 trillion market cap. That's a slightly larger weight than Amazon stock (6.9%), even though the latter has a significantly higher valuation at $1.33 trillion.

Tesla stock and Meta Platforms round out the top-seven members, with weights of 4.5% and 4.3%, respectively.

Just for reference, for the entire Nasdaq composite, Apple stock had an 11.4% weighting as of July 7 while Microsoft was at 9.5%. GOOGL stock is at 5.8% while Amazon and Nvidia are at 5.1% and 4%, respectively. TSLA stock has 3.3% share and META stock is at 2.8%.

How Much Will Nasdaq 100 Megacaps Be Cut?
Based on Nasdaq 100 methodology, the combined weight of the five companies with the largest market caps will be set to 38.5%. The five-largest companies, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Nvidia had a combined weight of 46.7%. That suggests some notable reduced weightings for these names.

Meanwhile, no component outside the top-five market cap companies can have a Nasdaq 100 exceeding the lesser of 4.4% or the weight of the stock with the fifth-largest market valuation. That points to at least a slight decline in TSLA stock's weight.

The official reweightings should be released on Friday, perhaps after the close. That will also include stocks that will see increased weightings.

Magnificent Seven Soar In 2023
The Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ), which tracks the big-cap Nasdaq index, was up 37.5% in 2023 through July 7. The First Trust Nasdaq 100 Equal Weighted Index ETF (QQEW), which gives an equal weight to all 100 stocks, is up just 18.8%.

This largely reflects massive moves by megacaps this year. NVDA stock has nearly tripled (191%). META stock has soared 141% while TSLA stock is up 123%. AMZN stock has leapt 54.5%. AAPL stock has run up 47% and MSFT stock nearly 41%. Google stock is up a still-robust 35%.

There is some concern that this handful of names is distorting the health of the overall stock market, which is likely what's spurring the special rebalancing.

Will Nasdaq 100 Special Rebalance Affect Stock Prices?
The Nasdaq 100 special rebalance will spur stock allocation shifts among ETFs such as QQQ and mutual funds that track the index. So there could be some one-off gains or losses, perhaps as the planned changes are announced on July 14.

However, the impacts may be modest. For one, the big-cap Nasdaq index is going to adjust weightings, vs. a full addition or deletion. Also, far more money tracks the S&amp;P 500, which is why S&amp;P 500 component changes get a lot more attention than Nasdaq 100 moves.

The S&amp;P 500 index, unlike the Nasdaq 100, is a pure market-cap weighted index.

Most of the ""magnificent 7"" stocks retreated Monday. Nvidia stock fell just 0.8%, while Apple slipped 1.1%. more than 1% intraday. Microsoft stock retreated 1.6%, TSLA 1.8% and Amazon 2%. GOOGL stock sank 2.5%.

The one exception: META stock climbed 1.2%, as Meta's new Threads app topped 100 million sign-ups in less than a week.

Megacaps weighed on the Nasdaq 100, which fell intraday before eked out a gain. The equal-weight QQEW jumped 1.8%.","stocks",49,"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/14w58g3/nasdaq_100_plans_special_rebalance_to_curb/"

*Please Note: Apologies for not sending the Daily Recap out yesterday, I was having technical issues on my end. Thankfully, all the issues were resolved, it's full steam ahead.*

Stocks traded mixed today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) rising while the Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly after hitting record highs for many consecutives days. In short, stocks continue to hover near record highs. Market participants are encouraged a stronger-than-expected gain on private payrolls and tempered inflationary fears. Looking ahead, market participants wait for Q2 earnings season and incoming economic data. 

Today, ADPs June private payroll report showed private payrolls increased faster than expected[.](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/adp-june-private-payrolls-jobs-market-pandemic-economy-recovery-121542029.html) This underscores the ongoing economic recovery with the US economy reporting its sixth straight monthly increase in employment. Job openings rose by 692,000 versus the 600,000 expected. Consumer confidence has also risen and pointed to Americans' increased propensity to spend, with the Conference Board's consumer confidence index racing to its highest level since February 2020. 

David Lefkowitz, UBS Global Wealth Management Head of Equities, said If you look at what's really been powering the economy and powering the stock market, it's been the fact that there's been so much fiscal stimulus poured into the economy. What's really crucial though is that a lot of that fiscal stimulus has actually not been spent this year. It's sitting on the balance sheets of consumers."" I totally agree. Consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP. Now that the economy is reopening thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, I expect saving-laden consumers to step out and spend big this summer after enduring social distancing guidelines for more than a year. 

Today marks the last trading session of the second quarter of the year, so I thought it would be useful to take a look back at the performance of different assets since March. Year-to-date through Tuesday's close, the S&amp;P 500 has increased 14.3%, the Nasdaq by 12.7% and the Dow by 12%. The 10-year Treasury yield hit a year-to-date peak of 1.77% in March but is on track to end the quarter yielding just under 1.5%. The West Texas intermediate crude oil rebounded by 23% as demand for energy picks up. Digital currencies, on the other hand, had a very difficult quarter, with prices sharply down across the board compared to the beginning of the quarter. 

**Highlights**

* Pending home sales were up 8% in May month-on-month, helping reverse April's 4.4% drop, according to data from the National Association of Realtors. This brought the pending home sales index to 114.7, or the highest reading for the month of May since 2005. 
* Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi (DIDI) began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company sold 316.8 million shares to raise $4.4 billion, making it one of the largest initial public offerings of a Chinese company in the U.S. since Alibaba's (BABA) $25 billion listing in 2014. Trading began trading at $18, roughly 29% higher than its $14 IPO price, though throughout the session the stock lost most of its IPO gains.

* PayPal (PYPL) is intensifying competition with Square (SQ) by launching its own physical card reader to put in stores. While both are undisputed leaders in fin-tech, PYPL has always focused more intensely on peer-to-peer transactions while SQ put more of an emphasis on consumer-to-business transactions.

Stocks traded mixed today as market participants digested a host of new developments around Pres. Trumps health after his COVID diagnosis, Chairman Powells remarks, the prospect for additional fiscal stimulus, and the resurgence of the Virus in some hotspots.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 1.78% down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished the day 1.42%, and the Dow (DIA) finished the day 1.37% down.

Today, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave a virtual address at the National Association of Business Economics annual address to discuss the Feds outlook for the economy during this pandemic. In his address, Powell once again (for the hundredth time it seems) reiterated the need of further fiscal stimulus to support the pandemic-stricken economy and promote faster recovery. He said, The recovery will be stronger and move faster if monetary policy and fiscal policy continue to work side by side to provide support to the economy until it is clearly out of the woods.

Elsewhere, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi echoed Powells comments. She said. Chairman Powells warning could not be more clear: robust action is immediately needed to avert economic catastrophe from the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic. It is long overdue for Republicans to join us in passing a bill that meets the needs of the American people. 

At the moment of writing this recap, Pres. Trump tweeted Nancy Pelosi is asking for $2.4 Trillion Dollars to bailout poorly run, high crime, Democrat States, money that is in no way related to COVID-19. We made a very generous offer of $1.6 Trillion Dollars and, as usual, she is not negotiating in good faith. I am rejecting their request, and looking to the future of our Country. I have instructed my representatives to stop negotiating until after the election when, immediately after I win, we will pass a major Stimulus Bill that focuses on hardworking Americans and Small Business. Immediately after this tweet, the markets turned sharply downwards and the VIX turned sharply upwards (VIX is an indicator of market participants risk sentiment). Pelosi responded by saying, Trump is not willing to crush the virus and that he puts himself before the nation

Trump departed Walter Reed National Military Medical Center yesterday and returned to the White House, just days after entering the hospital on Friday to be treated for Covid-19. White House physician Dr. Sean Conley said Trump had met or exceeded all standard hospital discharge criteria, while conceding that he may not be entirely out of the woods yet in his recovery process.

Just four states in the US are reporting a decline in coronavirus cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. In Wisconsin, new cases are averaging at about 2,400 daily -- the third highest in the country behind Texas and California. That's up 15% from what the state was averaging in the previous week. At least 22 states are reporting more new cases than the previous week, with many across the Midwest and now increasingly in the Northeast.

**Highlights**

* Crude oil rose above $40 per barrel.
* Shares of Boeing (BA) fell after the company announced cuts to its 10-year outlook for aircraft demand amid falling demand due to the pandemic.
* White House agrees to FDAs guidelines for vetting COVID-19 vaccine candidates. 
* N.Y. COVID Patients hospitalized are 700 today, highest single day total since July.

* Apple announced an event on Oct. 13, which analysts believe will be used to announce the new model of iPhones and their 5G compatibility. 
* Teslas (TSLA) new factory in Berlin is being constructed at record pace. The factory is expected to produce Tesla's Model Y, Model 3 and eventually a more affordable $25,000 Tesla. Now a new post from Tesla fan site Tesmanian has quoted anonymous sources claiming up to 4,000 employees will be working in the new factory by March 2021. Vehicle production is scheduled to start June 2021.

Stocks traded mixed, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) extending gains from last week to reach new intraday record highs. On the other hand, the Dow Jones (DIA) was driven slightly lower due to weakness in financial and energy stocks while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, broke its winning streak to close 0.41% lower. Market participants continue to digest the Federal Reserves annual Jackson Hole Symposium and a key speech by Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday. Looking ahead, market participants await a busy week for new economic data, with the August Jobs Report due out on Thursday.

Despite hawkish statements by other Federal Reserve members in the July meeting minus, in his speech Powell remained highly accommodative, suggesting he was more inclined to wait to see further progress in the economy before tapering QE, especially in light of surging infections due to the Delta variant. Powell said, At the FOMC's recent July meeting, I was of the view, as were most participants, that if the economy evolved broadly as anticipated, it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year. The intervening month has brought more progress in the form of a strong employment report for July, but also the further spread of the Delta variant. We will be carefully assessing incoming data and the evolving risks. Even after our asset purchases end, our elevated holdings of longer-term securities will continue.

Powell once again urged caution since the economic recovery in the market is still undergoing, saying effects from an ill-timed policy shift would arrive after the need has passed and could be particularly harmful. Here is the full quote, The main influence of monetary policy on inflation can come after a lag of a year or more. If a central bank tightens policy in response to factors that turn out to be temporary, the main policy effects are likely to arrive after the need has passed. The ill-timed policy move unnecessarily slows hiring and other economic activity and pushes inflation lower than desired. Today, with substantial slack remaining in the labor market and the pandemic continuing, such a mistake could be particularly harmful. We know that extended periods of unemployment can mean lasting harm to workers and to the productive capacity of the economy.

Regarding inflation, Powell once again reiterated the need for caution but suggested he was prepared to act if incoming data deems it appropriate. He said, Central banks have always faced the problem of distinguishing transitory inflation spikes from more troublesome developments, and it is sometimes difficult to do so with confidence in real time. At such times, there is no substitute for a careful focus on incoming data and evolving risks. If sustained higher inflation were to become a serious concern, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) would certainly respond and use our tools to assure that inflation runs at levels that are consistent with our goal. Incoming data should provide more evidence that some of the supplydemand imbalances are improving, and more evidence of a continued moderation in inflation, particularly in goods and services prices that have been most affected by the pandemic. We also expect to see continued strong job creation. And we will be learning more about the Delta variant's effects.

Here is the full transcript from the speech, I encourage everyone to read it fully. Its not very long and is extremely insightful to see exactly what the main monetary policy maker thinks of the current state of the economy

[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm)

Regarding Powells speech, BTIG Chief Equity and Derivatives Strategist Julian Emanuel said, Powell ""did three things very, very right, and obviously the markets are celebrating that. First was keeping the speech succinct. Second thing he did risht is, he sent the rest of the Fed governors out over the prior four weeks to basically tell us all that the taper was coming. He merely had to reiterate, and reiterate softly, that message, which he did very effectively. The third thing is he really tackled inflation head on. He knew thats been the preoccupation of the markets for these last couple of months. While he didnt give any new real evidence as to why he views inflation as transitory, he did cite the ongoing moderation in commodity prices and the view that past history would indicate that inflation is likely to be temporary. 

Looking ahead, market participants are set to receive more data on the strength of the labor market recovery this week, with the Labor Department's August jobs report due out on Friday. Consensus economists are looking to see that 750,000 payrolls came back during the month, representing an eighth straight month of gains but a slight pullback from July's 943,000.

**Highlights**

* Shares of buy-now-pay-later company Affirm (AFRM) gapped up more than 40% after announcing partnership with Amazon (AMZN) that will let customers buy items of $50 or more in installments. 
* Shares of travel and leisure stocks slid after the European Union issued a new recommendation to restrict nonessential travel from the US due to surging coronavirus Delta cases. Here is the recommendation: [https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/08/30/covid-19-council-removes-5-countries-and-one-entity-territorial-authority-from-the-list-of-countries-for-which-travel-restrictions-should-be-lifted/](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/08/30/covid-19-council-removes-5-countries-and-one-entity-territorial-authority-from-the-list-of-countries-for-which-travel-restrictions-should-be-lifted/)
* July pending home sales unexpectedly dropped, according to data from the National Association of Realtors, likely due to high housing prices. Sales dipped 1.8% in July compared to June, nearly matching Junes 2% decline. Economists were looking for a gain of 0.3%
* McDonalds (MCD) sent a notice to instruct franchisees on steps they should take to re-close indoor dining in areas where the Delta variant is rapidly spreading. Originally, barring any COVID resurgence, McDonalds planned to fully reopen indoor dining by Labor Day (Sept 6)
* Apple (AAPL) announced changes to its App Store regulations that will allow software developers to tell customers how to pay for services outside of Apples ecosystem, part of a proposed settlement of a class-action lawsuit. The shift will make it easier for some apps to steer customers toward other forms of payment, rather than using the App Store, where Apple charges a commission of up to 30%.
* ESPN, which is owned by Disney (DIS), is reportedly seeking to license its brand to major sports-betting companies for at least $3 billions over several years, according to sources familiar with the matter as reported by the Wall Street Journal. On offer is the right for a suitor to use the ESPN name for branding purposes and potentially rename its sportsbook after ESPN. The sports-media giant has held talks with players that own major sportsbooks, including casino operator Caesars Entertainment (CZR)[ ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CZR?mod=chiclets)and DraftKings (DKNG) the sources said. ESPN has existing marketing partnerships with both companies already. This is huge for the sports-betting industry, will be closely following this story.
* Amazon-backed (AMZN) electric vehicle maker Rivian is reportedly seeking a $70-$80 billion valuation in its upcoming IPO. The company has an agreement to produce electric vans for Amazon and a pickup truck for consumers. In my humble opinion, even being backed by Amazon, this valuation is insane.

Stocks continued yesterdays momentum, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closing 1.51% up, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 2.21% up, while the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 1.11% up. The price action this week has been nothing short of remarkable, with the market selling off in the first three days of the week before recovering Thursday and Friday. In my view, this week was like a battle between the inflationary fears spooking market participants that the Fed will tighten rates sooner than expected while the April Job report, which greatly missed estimates and marked a sharp deceleration in job growth compared to March bolstered confidence in the Feds commitment to maintaining monetary policy accommodative until it sees a string of strong labor reports like the one in March. While I said all week that I thought the initial sell-off was an overreaction (and it seems to be that way judging from the last two days), short-term volatility may continue going into next week, too early to tell if the market is beginning a new uptrend or is just bouncing.  

On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the consumer price index (CPI), which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

Yesterday, the producer price index (PPI), which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year. This is the biggest jump since 2014. In tandem with the CPI report, this shows prices for both consumers and producers have increased more than expected. 

However, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be transitory as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a string of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, theres a very large group of people who are not. The April Job Report bolsters Powells argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper well before the interest rate is increased. He said, We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance. In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, Im fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner-than-expected are overblown. Just my two cents.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, January 24, 2022**

What an action-packed day! After dropping steeply in the morning, stocks reversed sharply higher to close the day in the green as market participants look ahead to a busy week of earnings and new commentary by the Federal Reserve. 

**Markets Today (low of the day to closing price)**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -3.72% to +0.42%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -4.75% to +0.46%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -3.03% to +0.43%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -2.72% to +2.30%
* Volatility Index (VIX):  +18.71% to 2.24%
* NVIDIA (NVDA): -10.31% to -0.01%

* Shopify (SHOP): -11.45% to +6.39%
* Goldman Sachs (GS): -4.82% to -0.15%

This year has not been kind to stocks so far, with expectations for tighter monetary conditions by the Federal Reserve causing the 10-year Treasury yield to spike to spike to its highest level in two years, sparking volatility in technology and growth stocks which greatly benefited from easy financial conditions since 2022. With inflation persisting at a higher level than originally expected, members of the Fed are now calling for three to four interest rate hikes next year, with the earliest projected for March 2022. 

On Wednesday, the Fed is set to have its January monetary policy meeting and press conference by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, which is expected to produce no changes to existing policy. However, as the Fed looks in to rein rising inflation, the meeting will likely set the stage for the Fed to indicate the potential timeline for an interest rate hike. 

Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research, wrote in a note to clients Until we get a further selloff in risk assets, the Fed will simply not be convinced that raising interest rates and reducing the size of its balance sheet in 2022 will more likely cause a recession rather than a soft landing. Either outcome would dampen inflation, of course, which is why 10-year Treasury yields have stopped climbing. But only a soft landing would allow public companies to continue to post strong earnings. The risk of a hard landing is why U.S. large caps are under so much stress.""

As of the start of the week, only about 13% of S&amp;P 500 companies had reported quarterly results, according to Goldman Sachs. And so far, one trend that has begun to emerge has been relatively weak commentary about the outlook for this year. 

David Kostin, Chief US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, said Investors are very interested in forward-looking guidance from management, and recent information on that front has been concerning. Bank executives emphasized higher operating costs in the coming year. Following the release of 4Q results, only six companies in the S&amp;P 500 provided formal near-term guidance for 1Q 2022. Unfortunately, five of the six firms guided below consensus for next quarter, including three of the stocks that actually beat expectations in Q4."" 

Looking ahead, a number of large-cap stocks are set to report earnings results this week, offering investors a view into how companies are holding up amid surging Omicron cases, rising inflation, and a tight labor market. Here are some of the earnings I will be paying close attention to:

**Tuesday:** Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), American Express (AXP), Microsoft (MSFT), Capital One (COF), Texas Instruments (TXN)

**Wednesday:** Boeing (BA), Abbott (ABT), Tesla (TSLA), Intel (INTC), Lam Research (LRCX), Las Vegas Sands (LVS), ServiceNow (NOW)

**Thursday:** Mastercard (MA), McDonalds (MCD), Apple (AAPL), Robinhood (HOOD), Visa (V), Western Digital (WDC), Atlassian (TEAM), Valero (VLO)

**Friday:** Chevron (CVX), Caterpillar (CAT), Weyerhaeuser (WY)

**Highlights**

* IHS Markit's preliminary January services purchasing managers index (PMI) slid to 50.9 from December's 57.6. This marked the lowest level in about 18 months. Readings above the neutral level of 50.0 indicate expansion in a sector. Meanwhile, the institution's manufacturing PMI also fell in January to a 15-month low, reaching 55.0 compared to December's 57.7.
* AT&amp;T (T) is reportedly rolling out the fastest consumer broadband offered by major internet providers
* Tesla Inc on Monday fought back against JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co over a disputed bond contract, countersuing the bank for seeking a ""windfall"" following Elon Musk's notorious 2018 tweet that he might take his electric car company private. In a filing in Manhattan federal court, Tesla accused JPMorgan of ""bad faith and avarice"" for demanding $162.2 million after the bank had unilaterally changed the terms of warrants it received when Tesla sold convertible bonds in 2014.
* Meta Platforms (FB) said on Monday that its research team has built a new artificial intelligence supercomputer that it thinks will be the fastest in the world when completed in mid-2022.
* Texas and the District of Columbia sued Alphabet Inc's Google on Monday over what he called deceptive location tracking practices that invade users privacy.
* Luxury carmaker Mercedes-Benz is teaming up with self-driving sensor maker Luminar Technologies Inc. (LAZR) to pursue fully-automated driving 
* China cut its one-year loan prime rate by 10 basis points. The home mortgage rate was also cut by 5 basis points. Following the lending rate cuts, shares of U.S.-listed Chinese tech companies traded mostly higher in Hong Kong on Thursday, lifting the benchmark Hang Seng Index to its highest level in almost two months

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, September 27, 2021**

Stocks finished mixed, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) falling as technology stocks came under pressure by the rising treasury yield while the Dow Jones (DIA) rose, driven higher by strength in financials and energy stocks. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small caps outperformed, closing the day 1.48% higher. Market participants continue to digest the evolving situations in China and a bevy of news coming out of Congress. 

The Evergrande situation has been covered in detail in previous recaps, but there are a few updates. The company announced it was canceling plans to issue shares of its electric vehicle unit on the Shanghai stock exchange and its wealth management arm is facing an inquiry by the local government. 

In other news, a series of power cuts and even blackouts across eastern China, where most of the population lives as demand threatens to outstrip the countrys electrical supply, adding a new threat to the already slowing economy and likely further snarling already disrupted global supply chains ahead of the busy Christmas season. This can already be seen in the sky-high charter rates for container ships, which have risen 10 out of the last 13 days and have more than quadrupled since the beginning of the pandemic.

There are several reasons why electricity is in short supply. As more regions in the world reopen from pandemic-induced lockdowns, demand has skyrocketed, forcing already electricity-hungry companies to use more power. Export demand for aluminum, steel, and concrete, three of the most energy-intensive products, has been very strong domestically and abroad. Moreover, as electricity demand rises, it has pushed the price of coal, which is the main way China generates electricity, higher. 

Publicly traded companies, including suppliers for Apple (AAPL) and one to Tesla (TSLA), and Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM) issued statements on Sunday night warning that their factories were among those affected. Apple had no immediate comment, while Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

In the US, Congress members continue to race in order to pass legislation to fund the government until next year and prevent the government from defaulting and shutting down. This comes amid a backdrop of ongoing debates surrounding the bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure deal. 

Congress is set to vote tonight on a bill that would extend government funding through December while also raising or suspending the debt limit until the end of next year to prevent the government from defaulting on its debt, which would be disastrous. Unfortunately, something that is fairly routine (the debt ceiling has been raised 80 times since 1960 and three times under President Trump, with the latest suspension in 2019) has become a headline with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stating that he would oppose raising the debt ceiling. 

McConnell said he would support a clean stop-gap bill in order to avoid a government shutdown said he will not provide Republican votes for raising the debt limit. Wednesday of last week, however, McConnell said, America must never default -- we never have and we never will, as he then voiced his opposition to a bipartisan increase. 

David Kostin, US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note this morning, Speaker Pelosi and Senate Schumer announced that they will move forward with legislation that ties an extension of government spending authority to a suspension of the debt limit. Our political economist believes that the likelihood of a government shutdown increases the longer Democrats pursue this course. However, we find no major consistent reaction of the S&amp;P 500 to government shutdowns since 1980.

Here is a very informative article by the Associated Press: [https://apnews.com/article/debt-limit-explained-8c9cbcd3d0c4a8fe989a0110f5159f7c](https://apnews.com/article/debt-limit-explained-8c9cbcd3d0c4a8fe989a0110f5159f7c)

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said yesterday the chamber would vote Thursday on the bipartisan infrastructure deal, which the Senate passed last month. This would be the same day that lawmakers need to come to an agreement to fund the government to avoid a partial shutdown, which would take place Friday at 12:01 a.m. ET if nothing is done. 

**Highlights**

* Along with the news of power constraints in China, analysts at JP Morgan raised estimates for how long it will take customers to get the new iPhone 13, saying it will likely take more than four weeks for the pro models and 2 weeks for the base model.
* XLF, an ETF that tracks the performance of banks in the SPY, vastly outperformed the market today, closing 1.39% higher amid continued strength by financial stocks.  
Facebook (FB) pauses the Instagram for kids project after lawmakers and the public voiced valid concerns. 
* Facebook (FB) also said it will invest $50 million to partner with organizations/companies to build the metaverse, which is the name for a 3D, interactive, collaborative virtual space. In the latest earnings call Zuckerberg said It is going to require very significant investment over many years. Im sure we will see many more headlines about this in year to come.
* Order of durable goods, which are goods meant to last at least three years, in the US far exceeded estimates in August, suggesting that demand remains very strong despite supply-chain disruptions. Orders rose 1.8% in August, much higher than estimates of a gain of 0.7% and the 0.5% gain recorded in July.
* Google criticized EU anti-trust regulators for ignoring Apple as it launches an attempt to get the second-higher cort to annul a record $5.1 billion fine related to its Android operating system. Regulators allege that in 2011, Google used Android to cement its dominance in internet search.

"103","2023-09-02",1693674053,"Coca Cola vs Pepsi vs Monster","I plan on adding a soft drink company to my portfolio, because I don't feel like adding up on my positions, which are quite pricy, nor buying something like the QQQ or any growth fund which would increasingly expose me to tech.

The three choices are obviously Coca Cola, Pespsi and Monster.

Coca cola is the one trading at the lowest multiple, paying the highest dividend, and arguably the one with stronger brand recognition. I really like the fact that they are deleverging and consistently paying off their debt, however the growth has been lagging behind. Has less than half the revenues of Pepsi does (43bln vs 92 bln), but just over twice the net margins. I would say its the safest play.

Pepsi has done I think decent acquistions ( ex, Doctor Pepper ), and is growing slightly faster than Coke with a lower dividend. Very stable growth, a fair amount of debt (nothing too concerning). 

Monster growth has been, well, Monstrous. However the PE is 41 (10 more than pepsi, 16 more than coke), and since they never paid dividend the balance-sheet looks incredible. They have more cash than all liabilities, and are already doing buybacks, which for fast growing company is quite nice,as it means they can already return capital to shareholders while expanding operations, without using debt. I am not saying it is undervalued (PE 41), but given the current multiples and its track record, it doesn't seem too bad. The brand doesn't have the same track record of the other two, but is well known and the managment seems to know how to keep it relevant and in touch with consumers preferences. I don't think its going away (stressed overworked people needs energy drinks haha) but the future might be more uncertain than with the other two.

What are your thoughts on these companies?

The stock market carried on its momentum from last week, with all three major indexes (S&amp;P 500 (SPY), Nasdaq (QQQ), and Dow Jones (DIA)) powering to new record highs despite last Mondays steep decline, a sign that market participants remain eager and able to buy up any dips in the broader market. It seems market participants continue to weigh a variety of factors, including but not limited to: (1) faster-than-expected pace of economic recovery, (2) surging corporate earnings, (3) potential inflationary pressures, (4) labor market imbalances, and (5) concerns surrounding the coronavirus Delta variant. Basically, the market is balancing between expectations for rapid economic expansion moving forward and concerns surrounding inflation and the Delta variant.

Over the last several weeks, market participants have been gauging the likelihood that the spread of highly contagious coronavirus Delta-variant could begin to pressure the ongoing economic recovery in the US. Last week, concerns came to a head after several local counties in the US, including Los Angeles, re-implemented the mask mandate in order to try and curb the spread.  In the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with new cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 51,939 on July 25, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. 

However, it is important to understand that the rising infections are broadly concentrated in areas with higher vaccine hesitancy. According to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, There is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated. Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.

David Kostin, US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs said, We \[Goldman Sachs\] think the Delta variant should pose a minimal risk to the US equity market. From an economic perspective, widespread vaccinations and strategies focused on containment suggest limited medical and economic downside even if infections continue to rise. From a flows perspective, robust household cash balances and corporate buyback authorizations should continue to support inflows for equities, increasing the likelihood that market participants perceive a pullback as a buying opportunity

Later this week, investors will hear from Federal Reserve officials over the path forward for monetary policy, which will likely be informed by the increased concerns over the Delta variant and peaking economic growth rates. Analysts are predicting that the downside risks still present in the economy will continue to overshadow potential worries over inflation, which means members of the Fed are very unlikely to make any changes in the upcoming meeting. What I am most interested in from these meetings is hearing about a potential timeline to begin tapering quantitative easing (QE). I expect the Fed will make some kind of announcement regarding this before the year ends. The real test for equities is coming in 2023, when the interest rate is expected to begin rising.

Q2 earnings season is shaping up to be another record-breaking quarter, with corporate earnings continuing to be super-charged by higher than expected demand from savings-laden consumers. So far, 24% of the companies in the SPY have reported, and of these, 88% have so far topped analyst estimates, according to FactSet. 

**Highlights**

* As I was writing the recap, Tesla beat earning estimates, recording revenue of $11.96 billion, better than the $11.3 billion expected and up from $6.04 billion a year earlier. 
* Shares of Chinese stocks remain under heavy pressure, with investors spooked by the latest actions of the Chinese government. This comes after the CCP hammered ride-hailing company Didi, whose stock is more than 40% below IPO price after the CCP threatened to slap them with a record fine and pull the stock from US listing. Moreover, the CCP is forcing private-education companies into becoming nonprofits in an effort to lower the cost of education. 
* This week a lot of mega-cap tech stocks are reporting earnings, with Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), and Microsoft (MSFT) set to report this week. 
* Bank of America (BAC) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend on the 24th of September to US$0.21. This takes the annual payment to 2.0% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry.

The Labor Departments weekly unemployment report showed an unexpected rise in first-time filings, with new unemployment claims rising to 230,000 from 207,000 last week. Still, new filings remain near pre-pandemic levels. Continuing jobless claims improved to their lowest level since 1973. Here are the numbers:

* **Initial jobless claims:** 230,000 vs. 200,000 expected and an unrevised 207,000 during prior week
* **Continuing claims:** 1.559 million vs. 1.733 million expected and a revised 1.753 million during prior week

Meanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics December producer price index (PPI) showed a 9.7% year-over-year increase in prices paid by producers, the biggest jump since 2010. Core PPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, came in at 8.3%.

Omar Aguilar, Chief Investment Officer at Charles Schwab Asset Management, said The inflation picture obviously is something that people are trying to understand  the concept of PPI and the fact that we're getting ... numbers that we haven't seen in quite some time. The labor market seems to continue to be very tight and very strong, and I think investors are trying to understand what the implications might be for the reaction of the central bank.

[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/ppi.nr0.htm](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/ppi.nr0.htm)

The PPI comes the day after the Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed that prices for consumer goods rose 7.0% year-over-year, the fastest pace of inflation since 1982. CPI matched consensus estimates and showed a minor acceleration compared to November 6.8% print.

By category, prices for used cars and trucks and shelter were the largest contributors to the headline increase. The used cars and trucks index rose for a third straight month and accelerated to a 3.5% month-on-month rise in December from November's 2.5% increase. This index was also higher by a marked 37.3% compared to the same month last year. Shelter prices rose 0.4%.  

The core measure of consumer price changes, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 5.5% in December over last year, representing the fastest increase since 1991. This accelerated from a 4.9% annual gain in November.

Revenue in the fourth quarter was 74% recovered compared to pre-pandemic levels, and up 8 percentage points from Q3 2021.
* Microsoft is investing $50 million in a LanzaJet facility in Georgia that will produce jet fuel from ethanol next year, LanzaJet said. LanzaJet, based in Chicago, said it has nearly completed on-site engineering at its Freedom Pines Fuels Biorefinery, with plans to start producing 10 million gallons of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and renewable diesel per year from sustainable ethanol by 2023.
* General Motors (GM) said a trio of chips from Qualcomm Inc will power the ""Ultra Cruise"" driver-assistance feature on a luxury Cadillac sedan next year.

Despite some choppiness in the early morning, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) continued their run of strength, once again powering to record highs driven by strength in industrial and financial stocks. Relative to these two indexes, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) has recently been underperforming, a sign that we may be at the beginning of a rotation away from tech-stocks, which had recently been driving the market higher. Market participants are encouraged by the Senate passing a new $1 trillion infrastructure bill and a new in-line inflationary report.

Shockingly, we actually have some good news coming out of Congress. The US Senate gave surprisingly bipartisan approval to a $1 trillion infrastructure bill. The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nations roads and bridges, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nations broadband infrastrucutre. The vote, 69-30, was uncommonly bipartisan given the seeming contention the Republicans had for the initial drafts of the infrastructure bill. President Biden said, This historic investment in infrastructure is what I believe you, the American people, want, what youve been asking for for a long, long time. Mitch McConnell, who earlier in the year publicly declared 100% of my focus is on stopping this new administration said of the deal, I was proud to support todays historic  bipartisan infrastructure and prove that both sides of the political aisle can still come together around common-sense solutions. The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nations roads and bridges, bolster public transportation, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nations broadband and 5G infrastrucutre. Here is a full list of what is included: [https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-support-for-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-framework/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-support-for-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-framework/)

The Labor Department reported Wednesday that its consumer price index (CPI) rose 5.4% in July from a year earlier, in line with Junes figure and matching the largest jump since August 2008. The government said CPI increased 0.5% on a month-over-month basis, matching a consensus forecast from economists surveyed by Dow Jones.

Core CPI which excludes energy and food, rose by 0.3% last month, shy of a forecasted 0.4% increase and well below Junes rise of 0.9%. The core figure is up 4.3% over the last year, a slight deceleration from Junes 4.5%. Economists often consider core CPI to be a more reliable indicator since its insulated from the frequent swings in petroleum and food prices.

* A bipartisan trio of senators introduced a bill that would rein in app stores of companies they said exert too much market control, including Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google.
* Senators Richard Blumenthal and Amy Klobuchar, both Democrats, teamed up with Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn to sponsor the bill, which would bar big app stores from requiring app providers to use their payment system. This is probably not going anywhere.
* After a massive run of outperformance, chipmakers have lost some steam following a report that order-filling time has skyrocketed to 20-weeks, the most in the four years, according to Susquehanna Financial Group. Weve all seen the headlines about the chip shortage, this should come as no surprise. I see no reason why the issues would not be resolved moving forward.
* Ford Motors (F) announced it was extending its partnership with battery maker SK Innovation for production of EV batteries beyond North America and into Europe. Currently, both companies are jointly developing a factory to produce 60 gigawatt-hours annually in battery cells starting mid-decade.

#**DISCUSS!**

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

*****

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Friday, February 1st, 2019! :)**","stocks",6,"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/am25ic/todays_premarket_news_friday_feb_1st_2019/"
"108","2021-11-08",1636407797,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, November 8, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 8, 2021**

Stocks finished mixed today, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closing modestly in the red, breaking an insane rally pulled down by a decline in Tesla (TSLA) while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) continued their march higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, finished the day 0.33% higher.

Last week, the Labor Department released the monthly October jobs report, which showed the pace of employment greatly improved after two disappointing months, with the report citing declining coronavirus cases and increased demand for workers for the uptick. Here are the numbers:

* **Change in non-farm payrolls, October:** \+531,000 vs. +450,000 expected, and a great improvement over the +194,000 job added in September
* **Unemployment rate:** 4.6% vs. 4.7% expected, 4.8% in September

During a press conference, President Joe Biden said of the Labor report, Our economy is starting to work for more Americans. Thanks to the economic plan we put through in Congress earlier this year and a successful vaccine deployment, America continues to add jobs at a record pace. In this historically strong recovery, unemployment has fallen again today, President Joe Biden said during a press conference on Friday.

Though payrolls have grown every month so far in 2021, the economy remains more than 4 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic levels following plunges in employment between March and April of 2020. And the civilian labor force was still down by nearly 3 million individuals compared to February 2020 as of October 2021.

On the inflation front, market participants are closely monitoring the Bureau of Labors October Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which is expected to show yet another acceleration in consumer prices on both a monthly and annual basis, as ongoing supply-chain disruptions and labor market imbalances continue to cap production of goods at a time of soaring demand. Estimates as of Monday showed that consensus economists expect to see the CPI rise by 5.9% in October compared to last year, accelerating from September's 5.4% annual rate to reach the fastest rise since 1990.

Rubella Farooqi, Chief Economist at High Frequency Economics wrote in a note to clients, We continue to expect that a normalization of demand and supply constraint or time will take pressure off inflation statistics. The exact timing is uncertain, given we cannot predict when supply chains will adjust. However, our best guess is that prices will start moderating by the middle of next year - possibly sooner if goods that are stuff in ports reach their destinations in the early part of the year, which will result in an excess supply of goods after holidays.

**Highlights**

* Ford Motors (F) crossed the $20 per share threshold for the first time since mid-2001, with investors seemingly encouraged by the companys pivot into electric vehicles and the upcoming blockbuster Rivian IPO, of which Ford owns 12%
* Shares of Tesla (TSLA) fell today but held onto the critical $1150 support after CEO Elon Musk asked his Twitter followers via a poll if he should sell 10% of his stake in Tesla, a position worth roughly $20 billion
* Though it was unable to hold the gains by close, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) became the third company to breach the $2 trillion market cap threshold, joining Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT).
* Italy's antitrust regulator has started proceedings to fine Google for allegedly restrictive clauses in the terms of service consumers have to accept to use Google Drive.
* Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) surged more than 10% after Meta Platforms (FB, soon to be MVRS) selected their chips to power its data center. AMD explained that the two companies worked together to develop a high performance processor based on the companys 3rd Generation EPYC Processor.
* Moreover, AMD announced new chips called  [**AMD Instinct MI200 series accelerators**](https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1032/new-amd-instinct-mi200-series-accelerators-bring), which are optimized for high-performance computing and artificial-intelligence workloads. The company described them as ""the first exascale-class GPU accelerators."" AMD competes with **Nvidia** (**NVDA**) in GPUs. Sorry it sounds like jargon but as a massive semiconductor bull I could not be more excited for the future. Ive said it many times before but personally NVDA is my #1, AMD is my #2
* SoftBanks Vision Fund, the largest tech-focused investment firm in the world with over $100 billion in capital, lost $10 billion this quarter amid the regulatory crackdown in China. The fund announced it was launching a $9 billion share buyback amid pressure from investors. The groups largest asset, Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba , saw its valuation fall by around a third in the second quarter. Its stake in Chinese ride-hailer Didi, acquired for $12 billion, was valued at $7.5 billion. Another notable hit was Coupang (CPNG), a South Korean eCommerce company which gave up a third of its value.

Stocks closed lower in yet another volatile session as market participants digested the Federal Reserves latest monetary policy decision and Fed Chair Jerome Powells press conference afterward. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) rose by more than 2% to reach session highs just after the release of the Fed's statement at 2 pm EST. The index turned negative during Powell's press conference, closing lower for the fifth time in six sessions, extending this weeks insane volatility.

The Central Bank reiterated that the start of interest rate hikes is nearing as the economy progresses while inflation remains hot. Earnings season continues with many notable companies, including Tesla (TSLA) reporting after the bell.

All eyes were on the Federal Reserve, which released their monthly monetary policy statement today. In its first policy-setting meeting of 2022, the Fed reiterated that US economic activity and the labor market continue to improve despite the emergence of the Omicron COVID variant. 

However, rising inflation is weighing on members of the Fed, who signaled that the interest raise needs to rise soon to combat inflation. Higher rates could address inflation by raising borrowing costs and dampening demand  particularly for goods.

In its statement, the Fed said, With inflation well above 2% and a strong labor market, the Committee expects it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate. The Committee decided to continue to reduce the monthly pace of its net asset purchases, bringing them to an end in early March. It is likely the first interest hike will come either in March or April, after the Fed completes tapering.

Here is the entire statement: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20220126a1.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20220126a1.pdf)

In his press conference following the meeting, Chair Jerome Powell said, I would say that the committee is of a mind to raise the federal funds rate at the March meeting, assuming conditions are appropriate for doing so. 

But the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee unanimously agreed that it will soon be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, and Powells commentary suggests the first increase will happen on March 16.

David Bailin, Chief Investment Officer at Citi Global Wealth Management, said If you think about what's happened in the markets, it indicates the degree of sensitivity market participants have to what is going to be the new rate environment and the new liquidity environment. The Fed made a major reversal about five weeks ago when it said that it was both going to raise rates and also consider quantitative tightening, which effectively means that you and I are going to have to finance the debt that is necessary issued by the Treasury instead of the Fed. So with all of that, I think they're going to look at what happened \[in markets\] and they're going to say, our goal here is not to shut the economy and to make things slow. The goal here is to signal their willingness to fight inflation to the extent that they can.

After the bell, Tesla (TSLA) reported fourth-quarter results that beat analyst estimates in both EPS and revenue despite the company warning that supply chain issues could persist through 2022. Here are the numbers: 

* **Earnings:** $2.52 per share, vs. $2.36 per share expected
* **Revenue:** $17.72 billion, vs. $16.57 billion expected, up 65% YoY
* **Auto Sales:** $15.97 billion, up 71% YoY
* **Energy Generation &amp; Storage:** $688 million vs $815.5 million expected, down 8% YoY
* **Gross Margin:** 27.4% vs 26.6% the previous quarter
* **Net Income**: $2.32 billion, up a staggering 760% YoY

The company said, Our own factories have been running below capacity for several quarters as supply chain became the main limiting factor, which is likely to continue through 2022.

**Highlights**

* New home sales in the US jumped to a nine-month high, indicating strengthening demand despite high prices and limited inventory. Purchases rose 11.9% from a month earlier to an 811,000 annualized pace, better than the 760,000 expected.
* The trade deficit reached $101.0 billion in the final month of 2021, growing from November's upwardly revised $98.0 billion deficit, according to [new data from the Commerce Department on Wednesday. ](https://www.census.gov/econ/indicators/advance_report.pdf)Consensus economists had expected the trade deficit to narrow to $96.0 billion.
* General Motors (GM) plans to hire 8,000 new additional employees to accelerate the development of the EV and software services division.
* Ford Motor Co and longtime Chinese partner Jiangling Motors Corp have formed a joint venture aimed at strengthening Ford's sales efforts and reach in China, the companies said Wednesday. The partnership aims to sell Ford passenger vehicles -- mainly SUVs and vans -- built by JMC through a network of 181 showrooms in major Chinese cities.
* Snap Inc. has been training businesses to introduce products via AR camera overlays in its Snapchat app, so users can, for example, digitally try on a new lipstick shade or style of shoe. Now the company says businesses can add more information on top of their augmented reality advertisements, such as item descriptions, prices, and links to purchase.

Bottom line, the extreme volatility in the market, particularly in tech stocks, continued today, with tech stocks opening deep in the red before recovering throughout the day, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) going from roughly 2% down at open to close to break-even by close. With the market fluctuating so wildly, it is difficult to pinpoint the reasons behind this price action, but I think there are two main, competing factors contributing to the volatility the market has seen in the last two weeks or so. It seems that fears of inflationary pressures causing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected are affecting the market to the downside while the April Job Report, which missed analyst estimates and marked a sharp declaration in job growth compared to March, bolsters the Feds argument that it will not consider tightening monetary policy until it sees a string of strong labor reports.

Looking ahead, market participants wait for the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' April consumer price index (CPI) set to be released tomorrow and the producer price index (PPI), set to be released on Thursday. These reports will show the latest change in prices for consumers and suppliers, and are expected to show a significant jump over last year's pandemic-depressed levels as demand resurges as the economy in the US reopens. 

Last Friday, the April Job Report showed only 266,000 jobs added in the month of April, missing estimates of more than 1 million and marking a sharp deceleration from the 916,000 jobs added in March. Despite significant progress, the economy remains roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic levels, and both the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate remain well below February 2020. For months, members of the Federal Reserve, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have consistently said they expect any inflationary pressures to be transitory and want to see progress rather than projections in the labor market before they consider tightening monetary policy.  In an April 28 meeting Powell said, Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Put simply, Powell is saying that after the severe decline of prices following the quarantine in March, a rise in inflation as the economy recovers is not surprising and reflects transitory factors (transitory meaning not permanent).

On the other hand, market participants are spooked that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, a surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices. This, in turn, may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks. Market participants are anxiously waiting for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) set to be released tomorrow and the Producers Price Index (PPI), which are both expected to show a significant jump. Expectations for CPI are 3.6% year-on-year for the headline print and 2.3% year-on-year for the Core Inflation Rate (Core inflation rate is the one most people think about when talking about inflation). PPI is expected to be 5.9% year-on-year for April. If the numbers come out much higher than predicted, some analysts wonder if the Fed will realistically be able to hold out on raising rates for the foreseeable future. 

In short, the sharp deceleration in job growth shown in the April report serves to allay concerns that the Federal Reserve will tighten rate anytime soon, which may be why tech was able to bounce back somewhat today. For months, Jerome Powell and other members have reiterated they want to see significant progress in the labor market before they consider tightening policy and will telegraph their intentions well in advance. On the other hand, if the CPI and PPI numbers come in way higher than consensus estimates, inflation may begin to become a real concern for the Federal Reserve.

Today was another choppy day, with stocks ending the day mixed, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) climbing 0.14% while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) fell 0.48% and 0.89% respectively. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-cap stocks, fell 1.25%. It seems market participants were disappointed by a report from ADP, a leading employment services company, which estimated that private employers added half the expected amount of jobs in July. This sets a negative backdrop for the official July Jobs Report, set to be released this Friday. 

ADP, a leading payroll and human services software company, released its July 2021 Employment Report, which estimated that private employers added only 330,000 jobs in July, less than half the 690,000 gain expected by economists. While ADPs report isnt 100% accurate, its usually fairly close and sets a negative backdrop for the official July Job Report on Friday. ADPs report shows that the labor market imbalances stemming from the coronavirus pandemic remain. Moreover, with concerns surrounding the Delta variant increasing, that could be a relatively new factor adding more pressure. Here is the entire report: [https://adpemploymentreport.com/](https://adpemploymentreport.com/)

Concerns surrounding the highly contagious coronavirus Delta variant continue to rise, with Florida emerging as the US new epicenter for the disease. Cases in Florida have jumped dramatically, going from 2432 on July 1 to 38,776 on July 30 and have so far had three consecutive days of record infections. Thankfully, however, despite the surge in cases, the death rate has so far remained stable and relatively low, a sign that the vaccines are very effective at preventing hospitalizations and serious death. 

So far, 59% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) have reported Q2 earnings, with 88% of these beating analyst expectations, according to FactSet. This quarter is shaping up to be another record-breaking one, with corporate earnings growth rate expected to accelerate 85%, which would be the biggest jump since the Q4 2009. 

However, it is important to note that, despite beating earnings expectations, a number of these companies have pulled back, with tepid outlooks moving forward overshadowing strong results. Moving forward, given that most companies have so far exceeded pre-pandemic levels and the current quarter has an easy comparison to last year, expectations for growth are inevitably going to moderate. This said, I think the pullback in some stocks following earnings is an overreaction. 

**Highlights**

* Shares of Lyft (LYFT) fell roughly 10% despite posting its first profitable quarter. Earnings are very weird.
* Shares of GM slipped 8% after posting earnings.
* Shares of NovaVax (NVAX) gapped up roughly 20$ after the company announced an agreement with the EU to sell up to 200 million COVID vaccines. 
* Shares of some Chinese companies somewhat after pulling back yesterday following signaling that the CCP may be targeting video game companies next as the regulatory crackdown on tech stocks continues. Yesterday, shares of Tencent (TCEHY) and other tech stocks fell after a state-media called video games ""spiritual opium"". This prompted Tencent to say it will limit gaming time for minors and may even ban those under 12 from its platform. 
* Shares of Robinhood (HOOD) gapped up again today, rising roughly 50% today.
* Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida said Wednesday the central bank is still on track to begin raising rates off their current near-zero levels in 2023, as long as the economic recovery remains on its current trajectory. He said While, as Chair Powell indicated last week, we are clearly a ways away from considering raising interest rates and this is certainly not something on the radar screen right now, if the outlook for inflation and outlook for unemployment I summarized earlier turn out to be the actual outcomes for inflation and unemployment realized over the forecast horizon, then I believe that these three necessary conditions for raising the target range for the federal funds rate will have been met by year-end 2022.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, November 10, 2021**

The dizzying rally in the stock market came to a screeching halt following the release of a key inflation report that showed a greater than expected jump in consumer prices despite new jobless claims coming in at a pandemic-era low. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.8% lower, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.47% in its third consecutive red day while the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.61% lower. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed 1.58% lower.

This morning, the Labor Department released the monthly Consumer Price Index, which showed prices soared 6.2% in a year-on-year period, accelerating from Septembers 5.4% YoY rate, and higher than the 5.9% expected. This represents that fastest pace of inflationary expansion since 1990, though one has to take into account easy comparisons to last year. 

The staying power and magnitude of inflationary pressures has, perhaps, become the central question for market participants, with companies across the board reporting rising input costs and price hikes passed on to the consumers to preserve margins. While Q3 earning results have robustly demonstrated that companies in the SPY were largely able to navigate these cost pressures, the possibility remains that if inflation runs hotter than expected for longer than expected, it could begin to hamper consumer demand. 

Though the Fed has commenced a tapering in the pace of quantitative easing, members of the Fed have so far maintained that supply-chain disruptions and labor market imbalances caused by the pandemic have prevented producers from keeping up with demand, particularly as we head into the busiest time of the year, the holiday season. I broadly agree with this narrative, even the Fed has conceded that inflation could last longer than they currently assume. The latest Fed meeting minutes said, Most participants saw inflation risks as weighted to the upside because of concerns that supply disruptions and labor shortages might last longer and might have larger or more persistent effects on prices and wages than they currently assumed. Well have to see what happens in the coming months, if inflation doesnt begin moderating in the next 5-6 months, the Fed will likely be forced to step in and raise interest rates in my opinion.

With roughly 89% of companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) having already reported earnings, 81% of those have so far posted better than expected earnings per share and 75% of those reported better than expected revenue. FactSet projects that the year-on-year earnings growth rate for the index stands at 40%, though this number has continued creeping higher as earnings season unfolds.

After trading mostly even throughout the day, the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&amp;P 500 (SPY) sold off sharply in the last hour. Early in the morning, President Biden announced this morning that Jerome Powell was renominated to lead the Federal Reserve for another four years. Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard, who was Powells main competitor, was nominated as the Vice-Chair. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for more inflation data set to be released later this week. 

On Monday, President Biden announced he was nominating Jerome Powell for a second, four-year term as the Chair of the Federal Reserve and Fed Governor Lael Brainard as the Vice-Chair, ending weeks of speculation who would be tapped to run the nations Central Bank. Biden was expected to select either Powell or current Fed Governor Lael Brainard as Fed chair. Following the nomination, Powell will go before the Senate Banking Committee for approval, and if confirmed, will serve another four-year term. 

Eric Browne, Managing Director and Portfolio Manager at Pimco, said I think this was largely expected by markets. Certainly there were some conversations in markets over the last couple of weeks about Brainard potentially being elevated to the Fed chair position. But by and large the expectation was for consistency. You may see a little bit of a rally on the back of this with the expectation that policy is going to remain in place and intact, and everything thats been articulated already by the Fed is likely to continue into 2022 and beyond.

Looking ahead, more inflation data is set to be released later this week, which will provide further insight into the pace of inflation and any potential reactions by the Federal Reserve. The Core Personal Consumptions Expenditure (PCE) , which is Feds preferred measure for inflation, is set to be released Wednesday and expected to show a 4.1% year-over-year increase. This would be the biggest annual jump in roughly three decades.

After closing mixed yesterday, stocks firmly rose today as market participants digested more corporate earnings reports and the Weekly Unemployment Report, which showed improvement. Tomorrow, the Department of Labor will release its July Unemployment Report. This report is set to be a wild card, with analyst estimates ranging wildly from ADP estimating an addition of 330,000 jobs to Bloomberg economists estimate of 845,000 jobs added. Well see tomorrow.

The three major indexes powered higher today, with both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) recording fresh intraday all-time highs.

However, it is important to note that, despite beating earnings expectations, a number of these companies have pulled back, with tepid outlooks moving forward overshadowing strong results. Moving forward, given that most companies have so far exceeded pre-pandemic levels and the current quarter has an easy comparison to last year, expectations for growth are inevitably going to moderate. This said, I think the pullback in some stocks following earnings is an overreaction. 

**Highlights**

* The Weekly Unemployment Report came in roughly in-line with analyst expectations
   * First time jobless claims: 385,000 vs 383,000 expected
   * Continuing Claims 2.93 million vs 3 million
* The rally in Robinhood (HOOD) stopped, with the stock dropping more than 27% today, very crazy movement in this stock the last few days. On the other hand, shares of meme stocks advanced after falling a few days in a row. 
* Uber (UBER) posted a wider than expected loss for Q2. This bodes bad for the company since rival Lyft (LYFT) unexpectedly posted a profit last quarter.
* Shares of Etsy (ETSY) sank 10% after the company posted slightly disappointed during earnings. 
* Shares of DataDog (DDOG) gapped up after the company smashed earnings estimates 
* Penn National Gaming (PENN) acquired Score Media (SCR), the largest sports media app in Canada and the third largest in the US for $2 billion in cash and stock. Jay Snowden, President and CEO said of the acquisition, theScores unique media platform and modern, state-of-the art technology is a powerful complement to the reach of Barstool Sports and its popular personalities and content. We are now uniquely positioned to seamlessly serve our customers with the most powerful ecosystem of sports, gaming and media in North America, ultimately creating a community that doesnt currently exist. I personally like this stock.
* In a White House event, the Biden administration and auto makers committed to try and get EV sales to make up 50% of cars sold in the US by 2030, contingent on the government support for the transition.

Stocks once again traded very choppily, with the market pulling back before reversing intraday to finish mixed. Market participants continue to closely monitor developments around stimulus talks, rising coronavirus infections, and the final presidential debate last night. 

The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) performed the best today, finishing the day 0.29% up. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 0.2%, and the Dow Industrial Average (DIA) fell a modest 0.11%.

It appears almost certain that there will not be additional stimulus before the November election, a mere eleven days away. House Speaker Pelosi still thinks its possible for a bill to pass before the election, but says its up to President Trump. She said, We put pen to paper& we are writing the bill, and hopefully we will be able to resolve it& we could do that before the election if the president wants to. Any additional stimulus will likely include a new round of checks and more money for unemployment benefits, schools, state, and local governments. 

This morning, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow told Bloomberg TV that the balls not really moving much right now in discussions, and that he doesnt want to make any predictions about the timing of an agreement.

Unfortunately, in the US, around 71,600 new cases were recorded yesterday, according to data from John Hopkins. According to CBS News that is the fourth-highest number of new infections reported in the country since the pandemic began and the highest number reported since July. During the debate, Joe Biden warned of a dark winter coming and once again urged the public to wear masks and follow federal social distancing guidelines. President Trump, on the other hand, incorrectly claimed that the virus was going away and that the US is rounding the corner. These statements were meant with severe criticism from health officials and are simply not true from a numbers perspective, the country is averaging more than 50,000 new infections a day and it appears to be climbing.

In Europe, governments and health officials are scrambling to deal with a surge of infections across the continent, with many fearing a second wave. Millions across Europe are now facing tougher coronavirus restrictions. Italy, France, Spain, Germany, and elsewhere are introducing curfews in large regions of the country in a bid to stem the recent spike in cases. In England, the government has imposed restrictions in the capital of London and in cities in the Northern parts of the country.

**Highlights**

* Intel (INTC) sold off more than 10% after the company unexpectedly posted a quarterly decline in data center chip sales, driven by a near-halving of revenue from enterprise and government clients during the pandemic.
* Today, remdesivir, Gileads (GILD) antiviral treatment, became the first drug to receive formal approval by the FDA to treat Covid-19. The drug was used as part of President Trumps treatment after his diagnosis earlier this month.
* Tesla (TSLA) plans to recall more than 29,000 of its Model S and Model X vehicles from China after problems with the cars' front and rear suspension were discovered.
* Wells Fargo (WFC) is reportedly planning to sell its asset management business for around $3 billion.
* AstraZeneca (AZN) reported that its COVID-19 vaccine trial will resume in the U.S. The Phase 3 clinical trial for the vaccine candidate that the company is developing with the University of Oxford was placed on hold in multiple countries over concern about an unexplained illness. The trial has already been restarted in the U.K.
* Remark Holdings (MARK) jumped 39% in late-afternoon trading on Friday after the company tweeted that for the first time, the company is selling its technologies in partnership with Intel (INTC)
* Joe Biden's remarks Thursday that he would seek to phase out oil stoked concerns among some oil and gas executives that a Democratic administration would further weigh down an industry hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic.     
* Salesforce.com (CRM) had a price target raised by Barclays from $264 to $315 at OVERWEIGHT. The stock is at $250 so implies a 25% upside! Very bullish call
* Datadog (DDOG) had a price target raised by Barclays from $126 to $136 at OVERWEIGHT. Stock is at $102 so a 33% upside implied.
* Discover Financial Services (DFS) had a price target raised by Deutsche Bank from $55 to $74 at HOLD, by Royal Bank of Canada from $61 to $75 at OUTPERFORM, and by BMO Capital from $76 to $80 at OUTPERFORM.
* Danaher (DHR) had a price target raised by Royal Bank of Canada from $250 to $273 at OUTPERFORM, and by Robert W. Baird from $205 to $252 at OUTPERFORM
* Southwest Airlines (LUV) received some love today from analysts. The following raised price targets: Raymond James from $45 to $49 at STRONG BUY, Credit Suisse from $46 to $51 at OUTPERFORM, Cowen from $43 to $46 at OUTPERFORM, UBS Group from $48 to $52, and Morgan Stanley the most bullish from $56 to $59 at OVERWEIGHT. This chart looks so good! Believe there's an opportunity here.
* Service Now (NOW) received a price target raised from $465 to $560 and from POSITIVE to OUTPERFORM. We really like this one, and its chart currently!
* Microsoft (MSFT) received a price target raise from Barclays from $234 to $249 at OVERWEIGHT. We like this one.
* The Boston Beer (SAM) has been nothing short of spectacular this year! Had a price target raised by Deutsche Bank from $835 to $996 at HOLD, and Smith Barney Citigroup raised the target from $1,015 to $1,150. This is a crazy one as analysts can't seem to keep up with the stock!
* Slack Technologies (WORK) received a price target raise from Barclays from $31 to $36 at OVERWEIGHT. The stock is at $28 so implies a 25% upside.

Stocks continued their momentum, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) once again reaching intraday record highs. It seems market participants have looked past the Federal Reserves July meeting minutes, which included language signaling that tapering may begin sooner rather than later, and continue to digest Q2 record-breaking earnings season and new developments coming out of Washington D.C. Looking ahead, market participants await Fed Chair Jerome Powell annual Jackson Hole speech, scheduled this Friday morning.

This earnings season has been a smashing, record-breaking success. 91% of companies in the SPY have reported, with 87% of those outperforming estimates in revenue. The blended, year-over-year earnings growth rate is an eye-popping 85.1%, absolutely smashing original estimates of 66.5%. What is most remarkable is this comes among a resurgence of coronavirus cases due to the delta variant, supply-side disruptions, and labor market imbalances in the US. 

US Crude oil prices continued gaining, building on advances after recently hitting a seven-day consecutive losing streak. West Texas intermediate crude oil rose by nearly 3% on Tuesday to settle at $67.54 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, also gained to top $71 per barrel.

Energy prices gained as optimism mounted over a pick-up in consumer mobility following the full FDA approval of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine. U.S. crude oil prices have so far risen 39% for the year-to-date.

Yesterday, The House of Representatives voted to adopt a $3.5 trillion budget resolution, taking a major step toward enacting President Bidens ambitious economic agenda that calls for increased spending on education, health care and renewable energy. The 220-212 vote, which fell along partisan lines, was originally delayed after a group of moderate Democrats said they would not approve the budget until the infrastructure bill was voted on. 

Following the vote, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, Passing an infrastructure bill is always exciting for what it means in terms of jobs and commerce in our country. President Biden thanked every member of the House, saying, There were differences. Strong points of view. Theyre always welcome. Whats important is that we came together to advance our agenda.

Federal Reserve's virtual Jackson Hole Symposium, which kicks off on Thursday. After last week's July Federal Open Market Committee meeting minutes came off as more hawkish than many market participants were expecting, more clues on the path forward for monetary policy remain a key focal point. Namely, traders are looking to see whether central bank officials signal when they will announce and implement tapering of pandemic-era quantitative easing.

**Highlights**

* Mortgage applications unexpectedly rose, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. Overall applications were up 1.6% during the week ended August 20, following a drop of 3.9% during the previous week. Home purchases led the advances, with these rising 3% week-on-week on a seasonally adjusted basis to reach the highest level since early July.
* Western Digital (WDC) is in advanced talks to merge with Japanese semiconductor company Kioxia in a deal valued roughly $20 billion.
* Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) continued absolutely beasting, which makes me so happy. As I have said before, NVDA is by far my favorite stock in the market.
* President Joe Biden called cybersecurity a ""core national security challenge"" in a meeting with leaders from Silicon Valley, the water and energy sectors, the banking and insurance industries and academic institutions on Wednesday to discuss [shoring up the nation's cybersecurity.](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/12/politics/cybersecurity-executive-order/index.html) IMO cybersecurity stocks are a great place to look into for future value.

Stocks sank today to end the week lower, with technology and growth stocks cratering as market participants digested further updates regarding the Omicron variant and recent marks made by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, alongside the Labor Departments November jobs report. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the week -1.2% lower, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) slid -2.6% and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell -1.83%. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed the week a whopping -5.24% lower. 

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -0.87%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -1.74%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.11%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -2.05%
* VIX: +8.71%
* NVIDIA: -4.46%
* Tesla (TSLA): -6.42%
* DocuSign (DOCU): -42.22%
* Asana (ASAN): -26.40%
* Marvell Tech (MRVL): +17.70%

Development surrounding the new Omicron variant remains front and center of the markets attention. So far, at least five US states have reported at least one case of the variant and over three dozen countries globally. A new report by the World Health Organization (WHO) has so far seen a suggestion that there is increased transmissibility of the Omicron variant. However, the report notes that it is still too soon and not enough data is available to make any conclusions yet. 

Vaccine makers released new, less optimistic commentary regarding how effective existing vaccines are against the new Omicron variant. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said their current vaccine would likely see a material drop in effectiveness against the Omicron variant. 

He said, There is no world, I think, where \[the effectiveness\] is the same level	we had with \[the\] Delta \[variant\]. I think its going to be a material drop. I just dont know how much because we need to wait for the data. But all the scientists Ive talked to	.	.	. are like, This is not going to be good.

[https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f](https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f)

Moreover, the market move today coincides with the release of the Labor Departments November job report, which showed a disappointing hiring rate even as the unemployment rate fell to a fresh pandemic-era low. Here are the numbers

* Payroll Gains: +210,000 vs +550,000 expected
* Unemployment Rate: 4.2% vs 4.6% in October

Jim Smiegiel, Chief Investment Officer at SEI Investments, said The markets ... have been pricing in, really, a worst-case scenario. I think the market is now switching gears a little bit and perhaps lessening the intensity of the potential for negative outcomes. The big issue still remains more about the world government's reaction to the variant and what that means from a lockdown perspective. And that's what the market is still kind of struggling with at this stage."" 

J. Pows latest remarks before the Senate Banking Committee further spooked the markets, after he said he would back off from using the word transitory to describe rising inflation. This is very notable because the Central bank has been using the T-word since the beginning of the year, when it warned that steep differences in year-over-year comparisons and supply-chain bottlenecks would lead to elevated inflation. 

Powell said, We tend to use \[the word transitory\] to mean that it wont leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation. I think its probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean.

Moreover, Powell suggested the Central Bank was considering completing its asset purchase taper a few months sooner than previously telegraphed. Market participants expected a more supportive stance, especially with the new COVID variant, but instead Powell suggested his priority was now on curbing higher than expected inflation. 

Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment, said Chairman Powells commentary course-corrected the view on inflation and the potential need for quicker policy adjustment. The reality is hotter inflation coupled with a strong economic backdrop could end the Feds bond-buying program as early as the first quarter of next year. Ultimately, the transitory view on inflation has officially come to an end as Powells comments reinforced the notion that elevated prices are likely to persist well into next year. With potential changes in policy on the horizon, market participants should expect additional market volatility in this uncharted territory."" 

On a personal note, I am taking this opportunity to do some very small dip-buying (no more than ¼ position). As usual, I believe the market is overreacting (as it tends to do). While it is important to acknowledge the risks present in the market and be prepared to act if they arise, I personally believe Omicron fears are overblown (I remember we had the same song and dance when Delta was first discovered). More concerning is the Feds change in attitude towards inflation. That said, the only thing discussed so far has been accelerating the timeline for tapering asset purchases. As I have said for months at this point, I am not worried about tapering. If/when the Fed begins discussing raising interest rates, then I will step back and reassess. 

**Highlights**

* Shares of DocuSign (DOCU) cratered more than 40% after posting disappointing earnings and lowering guidance. Like Zoom (ZM), Teladoc (TDOC), and Peloton (PTON) before, this is the latest COVID stock to crater in value. 
* Shares of Chinese ride-hailing company DIDI gapped down once again after announcing plans to delist from the New York Stock Exchange amid regulatory pressures from the Chinese government. This is one of the most spectacular IPO failures I have ever seen and probably just the beginning. Im glad I divested all my shares in Chinese companies, I wouldnt trust a single dollar of mine in that environment. At this point, Im expecting Alibaba (BABA) to delist at some point. 
* As a reminder, a lot of times, when you buy Chinese stock, you arent really buying a share of the company, usually you are being what is called an American Depositary Receipt, which is basically just a contract representing a number of shares, not an actual piece of the company
* The Federal Trade Commission sued NVIDIA (NDA) to block the proposed $40 billion acquisition of Arm. Unfortunately, it doesnt look like the deal will go through given all the regulatory backlash in both the US, UK and EU. Sad for me, NVIDIA is my favorite stock in the market. 
* Ford Motor (F) expects to be the world's second largest electric vehicle manufacturer within two years, with annual production capacity of nearly 600,000, according to Lisa Drake, the Chief Operating Officer. 
* Shares of sport-betting company DraftKings (DKNG) sank to 52-week lows, losing more than 50% of its value in the last three months. Penn National Gaming (PENN) is following a similar trend. 
* Cathie Woods flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) hit a 52-week low today, after falling 25% in the month amid the broad tech-selloff. 
* Shares of Grab (GRAB), the largest ride-hailing and digital payment solution in Southeast Asia, failed spectacularly in its first day of trading following the largest ever merger, which valued the company at over $40 billion. Has not been a good week for foreign stocks.  
* Qualcomm (QCOM) on Wednesday released a new chip designed for gaming-specific handheld devices offering 5G connectivity, a potential new mobile platform for video gamers offering more flexibility to play streaming games on the go. QCOM said it partnered with hardware company Razer to create an initial test device for gamers.

Stocks fell today, extending the previous days decline in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) as market participants continue to digest the recent August Job Report and concerns surrounding rising coronavirus infections across the US. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) 0.33% down while the SPY and DIA fell 0.11% and 0.2% respectively. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 1.10%.

Yung-Yu Ma. Chief Investment Strategist at BMO Capital said, We think the fundamental drivers of strong earnings, an accommodative Fed, and a still healthy appetite for risk taking are really whats going to support the market for the rest of the year. 

The Labor Department released their monthly unemployment report, which showed hiring in August slow down dramatically as the US continues to battle massive spikes in coronavirus Delta cases in certain parts of the country, mainly the South/Southeast (according to the CDC, roughly S of all COVID-related hospitalizations are in Texas and Florida as both states deal with record coronavirus cases and low hospital capacity). Due to this surge and the reimposition of pandemic-era restrictions in areas with high transmission rates, employment numbers came in shockingly low compared to estimates and the previous months numbers. Here are the numbers.

* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** \+235,000 vs. +733,000 expected and a revised +1.053 million in July
* **Unemployment rate, August:** 5.2% vs. 5.2% expected and 5.4% in July
* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.6% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% in July 
* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 4.3% vs. 3.9% expected and 4.0% in July

President Biden said of the report, While I know some wanted to see a larger number today and so did I, what weve seen this year is continued growth, month after month, in job creation. This is the kind of growth that makes our economy stronger.

Members of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially closely at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the substantial further progress mark the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, I think that one more good job report if its in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering. August was not the report they were looking for. 

In its latest Beige Book, which is basically a report by the Federal Reserve on current economic conditions, members said the economy downshifted slightly due to Delta variant concerns. The report stated, The deceleration in economic activity was largely attributable to a pullback in dining out, travel, and tourism in most Districts, reflecting safety concerns due to the rise of the Delta variant, and, in many cases, international travel restrictions. 

In the US, the surge in infections in certain parts of the nation continues unabated, with hospitalizations this weekend roughly 300% higher than Labor Day weekend in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The surge in patients comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread across the US, and coincided with a weekend that saw a spike in travel. According to the Transportation Security Administration, more than 3.5 million people travelled across the country on Friday and Saturday for the Labor Day holiday, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions recommendation for unvaccinated people to refrain from traveling.

In other news, the battle between Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos is heating up! Last week, SpaceX sent a filing to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) accusing Amazon of using regulatory and legal means to stifle and slowdown competition. SpaceX said, While SpaceX has proceeded to deploy more than 1,700 satellites, Amazon has yet to even attempt to address the radiofrequency interference and orbital debris issues that must be resolved before Amazon can deploy its constellation and suggested as it falls behind competitors \[Amazon\] is more than willing to use regulatory and legal processes to create obstacles designed to delay those competitors from leaving Amazon even further behind (ouch).

In response, Amazon said, Whether it is launching satellites with unlicensed antennas, launching rockets without approval, building an unapproved launch tower, or re-opening a factory in violation of a shelter-in-place order, the conduct of SpaceX and other Musk-led companies makes their view plain: rules are for other people, and those who insist upon or even simply request compliance are deserving of derision and ad hominem attacks. If the FCC regulated hypocrisy, SpaceX would keep the commission very busy. SpaceX won this one IMO, that was a nasty burn. 

**Highlights**

* Job openings in July as measured by JOLTS soared by a staggering 749,000  hitting yet another all-time high just shy of 11 million open jobs, enough to eliminate most of the current slack in the labor market.
* El Salvador became the first country in the world to roll out a digital currency as a form of legal tender, allowing businesses and customers to transact using blockchain. There are some initial teething problems with the launch of the Chivo, the countrys wallet app and locals being unfamiliar with the technology. Digital currencies also fell, though I dont know unknown if the drop is correlated to the launch in El Salvador
* Damn, the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) market is red-hot right now. Following Sqaures (SQ) acquisition of Afterpay for $29 billion and Amazon (AMZN) partnering up with Affirm (AFRM) to offer BNPL on Amazon, PayPal (PYPL) is now stepping into the arena by acquiring Japanese BNPL firm Paidy for $2.7 billion
* Twitter (TWTR) launched a global test of a tool it calls Communities, a feature similar to Facebook Groups that gives users a way to tweet to people with similar interests. This follows the recent launch of Super Follows, where content creators can charge their followers for their content. 
* Applied Materials (AMAT) announced it was releasing two new tools aimed at improving efficiency of making a new class of chips for electric vehicles. The machines announced on Wednesday are designed for chips made from a material called silicon carbide. Such chips are gaining traction in electric vehicles like those made by Tesla Inc because they are more efficient and lighter in weight than standard silicon chips for transmitting power from a car's battery to its motors, helping improve range. Silicon carbide chips are difficult to manufacture because the material is very hard

**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 1, 2021**

Happy spooky season Psychos! Stocks advanced today, reversing hard in the morning to the upside, though all three major indexes closed out the week negative once again. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 1.19% higher but finished the week -1.86% down. The Nasdaq (QQQ) continued its streak of underperformance, pressured by rising Treasury yields, closing the day 0.51% higher but finished the week -2.71%, one of the worst weeks all year. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed the day 1.45% higher, driven by strength in financial and energy stocks, but closed the week 1.37% down. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed the day 1.68% higher but the week -0.38% down.

Market participants continue to closely monitor developments coming out of Washington DC, with Congress managing to avoid a government shutdown by passing a last-minute bill yesterday night.  Right before the midnight deadline, President Biden signed into law a short-term appropriations bill that will keep the government running through at least December 3, successfully avoiding a government shutdown. The Senate and House approved the funding legislation earlier Thursday. The Senate passed it in a 65-35 vote as all 50 Democrats backed it and 15 Republicans joined them. The House passed the bill by a 254-175 margin. Every Democratic representative and 34 Republicans supported it.

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/30/government-shutdown-congress-moves-to-pass-funding-bill.html

Focus will now shift towards debates surrounding the bipartisan infrastructure bill and raising the debt ceiling before mid-October, which is the estimated timeline when the debt ceiling will be hit. Earlier today, President Biden went to the capital to try and salvage plans for the infrastructure bill after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was forced to delay the vote she scheduled today. This is due to disagreements in the party between moderates and more progressive members, particularly with Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, who oppose the size of the infrastructure bill. https://www.reuters.com/world/us/democrats-struggle-reach-deal-congress-bidens-agenda-2021-10-01/

A historic U.S. debt default could occur around Oct. 18, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has estimated, if Congress fails to give the government additional borrowing authority beyond the current statutory limit of $28.4 trillion. The House approved a bill late on Wednesday suspending the debt limit through December 2022. The Senate could vote on it ""as early as next week,"" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, but Republicans are expected to block it again as they have twice before. This is an evolving situation. In my humble opinion, I think the Republicans are playing political games with the debt ceiling and will pass it last minute, similar to the spending bill to avoid the government shutdown. 

Put simply, a default by the US would be an economic and political disaster that must be avoided. I cannot fathom the government willingly plunging the US into an unprecedented financial crisis for political reasons, though one can never guess the future. According to a report by Moodys Analytics, one of the three big along with Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch Group, approximately 6 million jobs would be lost and the unemployment would spike dramatically, US GDP would decline, and there would be an irrevocable stain on the faith and strength of US financial markets. Internationally, the United States will have for the first time undermined the full faith and credit of its own currency -- a blow to our standing in the world and a boon for our adversaries such as China who are arguing to the world that the US is on the decline

The report goes on to say, Global financial markets and the economy would be upended, and even if resolved quickly, Americans would pay for this default for generations, as global investors would rightly believe that the federal governments finances have been politicized and that a time may come when they would not be paid what they are owed when owed it. To compensate for this risk, they will demand higher interest rates on the Treasury bonds they purchase. That will exacerbate our daunting long-term fiscal challenges and be a lasting corrosive on the economy, significantly diminishing it.

This is huge! Merck (MRK) said it developed an oral drug that reduces the risk of hospitalizations and deaths by around 50% for patients with mild or moderate cases of coronavirus and has filed for emergency use authorization with the FDA. Might be start time to look again at travel and restaurant stocks, a pill/oral drug would go a huge way to make people more comfortable and help make up for the gap created by vaccine hesitancy.

Stocks fell sharply on Monday, with technology stocks swiftly reversing from Friday to come under pressure once more as the risk of inflationary pressure and recent suggestions from monetary officials weigh on the mind of market participants. The Nasdaq (QQQ) sank 2.53%, its worst performance since March. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones (DIA) reached fresh intraday highs before pulling back while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) retreated from record levels, closing 0.95% down.

Market participants are spooked that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, a surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices. This, in turn, may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks. However, it is important to note that monetary officials, including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, have repeatedly said they expect any inflationary pressures to be transitory. In an April 28 meeting he said, Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. Looking ahead, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' April consumer price index (CPI) is set to be released Wednesday and the producer price index (PPI) on Thursday. These will show the latest change in prices for consumers and suppliers, and are expected to show a significant jump over last year's pandemic-depressed levels as demand resurges as the economy in the US reopens.

Further spooking the markets is recent commentary from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen where she suggested interest rates may need to rise to prevent the economy from overheating. She said, It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them."" In later remarks, she seemingly downplayed her remarks, saying that raising rates was not something she was predicting or recommending and that the decision ultimately rests with the Federal Reserve. She said, Let me be clear, thats not something Im predicting or recommending. If anybody appreciates the independence of the Fed, I think that person is me.

While it may seem like doom and gloom, this is the most important piece of the puzzle and why one shouldnt begin to panic about inflation or the economy overheating. Last Friday, the April Job Report reported only 266,000 jobs added in the month of April, missing estimates of more than 1 million and marking a sharp deceleration from the 916,000 jobs added in March. Despite significant progress, the economy remains roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic levels, and both the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate remain well below January 2020. The sharp decline in job growth allays fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy anytime soon, with Powell and other monetary officials consistently reiterating the Central Bank wants to see a string of strong labor market gains totalling more than 1 million jobs added before any adjustment to the current policy is made. With the April report coming in far below estimates, the labor market remains far below the Central Bank targets, meaning it is extremely unlikely to tighten its accommodative monetary policy anytime soon.

In short, a transitory rise in inflation is not surprising given the economy is recovering from a severe decline in prices from March 2020, and while substantial progress has been made, economic recovery, particularly in the labor market, remains far from complete.

**Highlights**

* Pfizer (PFE) and BioNTech (BNTX) submitted an application with the US FDA to approve use of their coronavirus vaccine for individuals 16 and older
* The Bank of England upped their growth estimates for the economy of the UK, anticipating GDP will grow 7.25% in the country, up from its forecast for 5% growth in February. The BOE also now sees inflation averaging 2.5% in 2021, up from its prior forecast for 2%, but said the rise in price pressures will likely be ""temporary.""
* The trial between Epic Games vs Apple (AAPL) has commenced. Epic has accused Apple of violating U.S. antitrust law and sued it in August after the tech giant yanked the developer's hit video game ""Fortnite"" from its App Store. Apple has defended itself by arguing that its app-marketplace policies are fair and that Epic breached a contract applicable to all developers distributing apps on its mobile devices by trying to make their own market place within the app store. Epic Games also sued Alphabet on similar grounds. Apple is facing a similar lawsuit in Europe filed by Spotify (SPOT)
* U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo plans to hold a May 20 meeting with senior U.S. auto industry leaders and other industry officials on a semiconductor shortage that has cut production, two sources briefed on the matter told Reuters.
* No price target increases today, technical issue on our end :(

**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, December 28, 2021**

After four positive sessions and a new record high yesterday, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) took a breather with tech stocks cooling down  in a very choppy trading session. Market participants continue to weigh surging coronavirus cases throughout the world thanks to the highly contagious Omicron variant. 

**Notable Numbers:** 

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -0.08%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -0.46%
* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.29%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.61%
* Volatility Index (VIX): -0.79%
* Krispy Kreme (DNUT): +10.85%
* Allbirds (BIRD): -11.39%
* Lucid Motors (LCID): -4.3%

On Monday, global COVID-19 cases hit a daily record, with more than 1.44 million infections reported worldwide.  Infections from the highly-transmissible Omicron variant  found to spread 70 times faster than previous strains  comprised much of the newly tracked cases. 

[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue)

However, it is very important to note that Omicron has so far been a lot less severe compared to coronavirus strains. three separate studies coming out of South Africa, England, and Scotland indicated that people infected with Omicron are somewhere between 50-80% less likely to be hospitalized when compared to previous coronavirus strains. 

[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html)

For context, more than 69,000 Americans were hospitalized with Covid-19 on Christmas Eve, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services. This represents an increase of around 2% compared to last week. While unfortunate, the figure remains below peak hospitalizations during the Delta surge and is half of the record-high from January, despite infections surging more than 50% in the month of December

[https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization](https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization)

In light of Omicrons lessened severity, the Center for Disease Control Prevention (CDC) eased guidelines for quarantining after exposure to Omicron, halving its recommended isolation time from 10 days down to 5 days. 

Data shows that the majority of coronavirus transmission ""occurs early in the course of illness,"" the CDC explained  generally in the one or two days before symptoms begin and two or three days after.

""Therefore, people who test positive should isolate for 5 days and, if asymptomatic at that time, they may leave isolation if they can continue to mask for 5 days to minimize the risk of infecting others,"" the CDC said in a statement.

[https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html](https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html)\\

The S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index showed prices for homes in the US continue to moderate for the third straight month, though numbers remain very elevated. The index, which tracks average home prices in metropolitan areas posted a 19.1% annual gain in October, down from 19.7% from September. The 20-City Composite posted an 18.4% annual gain, down from 19.1% a month earlier. The 20-City results came in very close to analysts expectations of an 18.5% annual gain, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.

The rest of the week is expected to be mostly quiet for investors, with trading volumes low and little economic data and earnings releases.

Looking ahead, the market will head into 2022 with  two key considerations to weigh: the course the pandemic takes and rising inflationary pressures and the Feds reaction to such pressures.

**Highlights** 

* U.S. President Joe Biden is considering Sarah Bloom Raskin to serve as vice chairwoman of supervision at the Federal Reserve, according to a Wall Street Journal Report.
* Fortinet (FTNT) a cybersecurity stock, was the best performing tech stock in the S&amp;P 500, rising roughly 150% year-to-date.
* A U.S. judge dismissed a lawsuit accusing Microsoft Corp's LinkedIn of inflating the number of people who watched video ads so the networking platform could overcharge hundreds of thousands of advertisers.
* US reality star Paris Hilton launches a new metaverse business, called Paris World, on Roblox (RBLX). While Im a proponent of the metaverse, its not surprising to see people trying to cash in on the hype. 
* For the first time since 2016, the S&amp;P 500 is set to outperform the Nasdaq this year. As of yesterdays close, the S&amp;P 500 is up roughly 28% this year compared to Nasdaqs 23%. This underscores the rotation out of tech witnessed in 2021.
* Elon Musk is drawing anger from Chinese officials after the country submitted a complaint to the UNs space agency alleging Chinas space station Tiangong, which is currently being constructed in lower atmosphere, was forced to take evasive action to avoid collision with two SpaceX satellites
* The new Spiderman movie No Way Home has absolutely demolished box office records this year, already grossing more than $1 billion since its Dec 17 theatrical release, selling more than double the tickets as the runner-up. I watched it& it was an amazing movie.

Stocks finished higher again, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) once again recording fresh intraday highs thanks to continued strength in mega-cap tech stocks like Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN). The Dow Jones (DIA), which has been lagging the other two indexes the last six or so weeks, continued to underperform comparatively. Market participants are currently digesting the Feds June meeting minutes (basically notes of what was discussed) and are looking ahead to Q2 earnings season, which is set to kick off next week with big banks reporting. 

Oil prices remain under heavy pressure after recently reaching a multi-year high. In the latest meeting, the two most important members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), failed to reach a deal to increase crude oil production as energy demand rebounds. At the time of writing, Brent crude settled down $2.63 a barrel, or 3.4%, to $74.53, after hitting a session peak of $77.84, its highest since October 2018. The U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures settled down $1.79, or 2.4%, to $73.37 after touching $76.98, highest since November 2014. Some analysts have speculated that in light of the failure to reach a unilateral decision, individual oil producers may begin to act alone to increase production. Bob Yawger, Director of Energy Futures at Mizuho, said The market is concerned that the UAE will step in and unilaterally add barrels and other members in OPEC will follow suit. The White House said Tuesday it was closely monitoring talks by OPEC+ and was ""encouraged"" after conversations with officials in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

For equity investors, the focus was squarely on the Federal Reserves June Meeting minutes, which will help market participants decipher that path forward for monetary policy and possible timelines for any adjustments. The Fed said the economic recovery was generally seen as not having yet been met, but said they are ready to act if inflationary pressures indeed begin to materialize. The minutes said, Participants generally judged that, as a matter of prudent planning, it was important to be well positioned to reduce the pace of asset purchases, if appropriate, in response to unexpected economic developments, including faster-than anticipated progress toward the Committees goals or the emergence of risks that could impede the attainment of the Committees goals. This is not surprising, as I have been saying for weeks now, as the pace of economic recovery improves, quantitative easing, or the purchase of government bonds in order to inject money into the economy, is always the first policy to be tapered. I am not worried about the tapering of quantitative easing and encourage everyone to read up about the 2013 Taper Tantrum, which happened when the Fed announced QE would be tapered since the economy had largely recovered from the 2008 crisis by then.

In short, the Federal Reserve is maintaining current policies in place but noted they were prepared to act if unforeseen pressures or progress to their goals emerged.Mark Haefele, Chief Investment Officer at UBS Global Wealth Management said of the minutes, If the US economic recovery continues to accelerate to a sufficiently robust level into the summer, the Fed is expected to signal rolling back its asset purchases later this year. But the actual tapering would only take place in 2022, and we believe markets have largely priced in this expectation. I fully agree, while I expect choppiness when the Fed makes more concrete statements about the taper timeline but do not see that derailing the current bull market. 

**Highlights**

* Lots of news surrounding Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi. Last week, the company went public on Thursday, however, over the weekend the Chinese government, in another crackdown of a large tech company, ordered Didi removed from app stores, citing cybersecurity complaints. Now there are reports coming out that Didi pressed ahead with the IPO despite the CCP suggesting the company delay due to security concerns. Shares are down double-digits in each of the sessions this week.
* The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary showed U.S. job openings increased to 9.209 million in May. This followed a downwardly revised 9.193 million in April, which was brought down from the 9.286 million previously reported
* U.S. mortgage applications declined for a second straight week last week, declining to the lowest level in a year-and-a-half as home price growth and low housing inventories weighed further on purchasing activity. 
* Pentagon officials announced they terminated Microsofts massive $10 billion Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) cloud-computing contract and said they would start fresh with a new project, putting an end to a yearslong initiative that was unpopular in Congress and mired in litigation from Amazon (AMZN). In terminating the contract, officials said they focused largely on technical reasons, saying advances in cloud-computing in recent years have made JEDI obsolete.
* Yesterday, Nvidia (NVDA) unveiled the Cambridge-1, which the company claims is the most powerful supercomputer in the UK. The computer will be dedicated to studying and analyzing the healthcare industry.

"128","2022-04-16",1650128275,"Beware the POWcycle","Hi, all.

I posted this earlier, but it's so deeply buried in a very long thread that no one will see it. In case it might prove helpful, here it is:

There's something that I call the POWcycle that has defined market conditions since mid-Feb 2021. The cycle is this:

1. Each month, the CPI is released;
2. Every six weeks, the two-day FOMC meeting is held; and
3. Right afterward, the JPow holds a press conference.

(Please note that FOMC meeting minutes are released three weeks after the FOMC meets; these can sometimes have a dangerous effect throughout the stock market, so you'll want to pay attention to the timing. Usually, no one cares, but in inflationary conditions like this, this can be an important catalyst, i.e. risk to try to avoid, depending on what's in them; you'll know based on the market reaction, which will occur within several minutes of the release of the meeting minutes.)

Often, because market participants anticipate and react to the future preemptively, there is a mini-crash sometime within ten days leading up to 1, and about one week leading up to 3. It might happen ten days before, but it's not very likely. It might happen five days before. It might happen the day of. Think of atomic orbitals and probability clouds.

What this creates is a situation where some periods are relatively less dangerous than others. To really try to figure out the most opportune buying and selling times, make a list of the companies that you're most interested in, and then research how they've behaved for the past year with respect to the POWcycle, and try not to get caught on the wrong side of it. Buy when the market is very red and others are afraid. Sell into strength, when the market is green and others think that the coast is clear.

Also note that sooner or later, the market will transition out of the POWcycle into another state. (At a macroscopic level, think of market conditions as a finite state machine. There are distinct states, but identifying the transitions isn't easy.) It will do this when what the Fed will do to combat inflation will truly have been priced in. Since the Fed doesn't know, and since we can't anticipate how the war against the Ukraine will unfold, never mind the virus and the disruptions to the supply chain that it'll cause in China and elsewhere, it's always better to be patient and try to err on the side of caution.

The JPow will hold his next press conference on Wed 4 May, which is eighteen days away. If the past fourteen months (with rare exceptions) replay themselves again, then we would expect another buying opportunity in the run-down to that event or during it. Again, we can't predict the future, but we can try to learn from the past and anticipate what might happen again, so that in case it does, we can be ready. That means knowing what we'd like to buy, and having a plan to buy it, including triggering conditions, the amount of capital to allocate to a full position in that security, a scaling strategy, and a risk management strategy.

There are three important things to keep in mind:

1. Valuation always matters. Learn to perform a DCF and establish a multiplier for the resultant fair price per share of a stock based on how similar companies' theoretical fair values are being multiplied by the current market conditions. (Multiplier contraction and expansion occur over time as the result of various factors; for instance, with growth stocks, it's a function of interest rate changes and sentiment, among other factors.) Don't just buy shares in a company. Know what they're really worth, and make comparisons.
2. As interest rates increase, the growth companies get hurt the most. This is because their cost of capital increases. (They have to pay more interest on loans. Even worse, they can get backed into a corner and be forced to issue new shares, which dilutes existing shareholders immediately and usually quite substantially.) Because they don't make a profit, they're forced to take out loans or issue new shares (there are other possibilities, but those are the main two) just to be able to keep paying employees. Unless they did this, they'd go bankrupt. This is why investors sell out of and avoid growth companies like the plague in inflationary conditions such as this. The reason that many of these companies have crashed by at least 60% is because they became drastically overvalued. When a company needs to operate for fifty years to make back its own market cap and it's simply not growing very much, it's important to not get trapped within it, because it might never recover, or it might flatline for a decade while other securities move way up. In the worst case, it could delete all of your money. Sometimes it makes sense to try to take advantage of others' fear. This is why I advocate buying MELI, PLTR, and SE while they're down. Within three years, the probability is very high that each of them will outperform QQQ.
3. Inflation is the single most critical driver of stock market behavior right now. The primary cause of inflation is the doubling of the money supply caused by all of the Fed's money-printing. Some of that money has been burned up by retail panic-selling for a loss, and as the result of margin calls. Both of these delete capital, as if it had never existed. While tragic for the individual or institution that realized losses, this ironically helps to attenuate inflation. The only ""problem"" is that not enough of it happens to have a major impact, but it does help a bit. Right now, we're in a trader's market characterized by high and unpredictable volatility, overvaluation, and inflation.

It hasn't been a great time to be an investor, and no one really knows how bad conditions will get, whether there will be a recession, how the labor market and fiscal policy will be affected, whether there will emerge a crisis for US debt repayments, given higher interest rates, etc. It doesn't take a macroeconomist to see that there's a lot more bad news than good. Because of all of this, I recommend proceeding slowly and cautiously. Don't get fooled by ""relief rallies.""

If you look at market dynamics, you find that for a long time now, there have been far more companies near their lows than highs. The winners are far and few between, and highly concentrated. This is why investors in index funds have outperformed growth stock investors by an incredible margin, for instance. This isn't healthy for the market. We've been looking very closely for signs that IWO (an ETF that's made up of the growth stock subset of the Russell 2000) has bottomed. No one is quite sure whether we might take out previous lows. This is why I'm personally being very cautious and waiting to see how the market will react to the JPow's upcoming press conference and the release of the subsequent CPI.

Market participants can ultimately only price in what they can reasonably anticipate. Anything unexpected hasn't been priced in, and no one has seen a downtrend in the CPI, among other factors, yet to be able to declare that the coast is clear. Proceed slowly. As we like to say, ""It's better to be late and safe rather than early and sorry."" I know that your money is being eaten up by inflation, but on a single month basis, the decline in buying power isn't very much. Wait for the right opportunity.

I hope that this helps a bit. Some of us run a free Discord server, but I don't think I can post it here. If anyone is interested, you're welcome to private message me.

Hang in there, and good luck,

**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 15, 2021**

Stocks steadily rose today, shaking off earlier losses and recent, driven mainly by the energy and industrial sectors, as market participants digested new economic numbers and the coronavirus situation in the US. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.83% higher, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 0.73% higher, the Dow Jones (DIA) rose 0.7%, and the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, rose 1.09%. Not surprised by this at all, I have been saying for months I remain bullish and have been buying on every dip until the Fed begins discussing interest rate hikes.

The Labor Department reported that its Consumer price index (CPI), which tracks the price of a weighted average market basket of consumer goods and services purchased, rose at its slowest pace in six months in August, suggesting that while the inflation rate may remain high for a while due to supply-side constraints, its likely the rate of increase has already peaked. Core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased 0.1% last month, the smallest gain since February and below the 0.3% rise in July. On a year-on-year basis, CPI has decreased to 4% from 4.3% in July, an encouraging sign. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the core CPI gaining 0.3% and the overall CPI rising 0.4%. It may not seem like it but this is a large month-to-month change.

The Fed's preferred inflation measure for its flexible 2% inflation target, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, increased 3.6% in the 12 months through July after a similar gain in June. August's data will be published later this month.

In global news, new economic data coming out of China suggests the recovery in the second-largest economy is losing steam. Retail sales, a key gauge of Chinese consumer consumption rose just 2.5% year-over-year in August, a massive deceleration from the 8.5% YoY growth recorded in July and a sharply missing estimates of 7% growth. Separate data released Wednesday by the statistics bureau showed home sales by value falling by 19.7% in August from a year ago, the largest drop since April 2020at the height of the pandemic.

**Highlights**

* Apple (AAPL) released a new generation of products, including the new iPhone 13
* US crude oil prices post rose sharply after the Energy Information Administration report that crude oil inventories declined by 6.4 million barrels last week amid pressure from Hurricane Ida, the lowest level since 2019
* US manufacturing production decelerated in August, likely due to disruption by Hurricane Ida and ongoing supply-side disruptions. The Federal Reserve's latest data showed manufacturing production rose by just 0.2% in August, or half the gain expected, based on Bloomberg consensus data. Production had risen by 1.6% in July. 
* EV-maker Rivian, which is backed by Amazon, hopes to raise as much as $8 billion in an upcoming US IPO.
* One of General Motors Co's China joint ventures said on Wednesday it is developing auto chips and aims to increase use of locally sourced chips in the next five years.
* Whatsapp, which is owned by Facebook (FB), launched a test of an in-app business directory.
* Volvo is also gearing up for a $20 billion IPO in the coming weeks, according to Reuters. 
* Elon Musk-led SpaceXs Inspiration4 rocket is scheduled to launch an all-civilian crew of four into orbit for three days on Wednesday, a mission that will be streamed live on Netflix (NFLX)
* **Sorry no price target upgrades, ran out of time**

Despite opening the day in the red, the three major modestly extended gains after the best day since July. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) rose 0.16%, the Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 0.09%, and the Dow Jones (DIA) rose 0.09%. Despite all the volatility this week and the risks that are present, the SPY remarkably managed to close the week 2.13% higher after one of its worst weeks all year. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell a modest 0.48% today but closed the week out 2.66% higher. Honestly, Im pretty surprised how well the market held up this week despite all the news. Next week will be interesting.

Theres a lot to unpack today. Two big news out of China today. First is the ongoing Evergrande situation which has been discussed in previous recaps. The company did not make its $83.5 million interest payment owed to bondholders and Chinese authorities have instructed the local government to prepare for the potential downfall if Evergrande fails. Well see what happens,.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell played down concerns of a contagion spreading to the US, saying The Evergrande situation seems very particular to China, which has very high debt for an emerging economy. He also added, In terms of the implications for us, there's not a lot of direct United States exposure. The big Chinese banks are not tremendously exposed, but you would worry it would affect global financial conditions through global confidence channels and that kind of thing. But I wouldn't draw a parallel to the United States corporate sector.""

In other news, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the countrys central bank, announced it was banning the transaction and mining of & sending prices of those assets falling. Here is the link to the announcement by the PBOC. Google translate worked for me.

In other news, the US government is close to reaching its debt limit if Congress doesnt finally agree to either raise or temporarily suspend it. Unfortunately, something that is fairly routine (the debt ceiling has been raised 80 times 1960 and three times under President Trump, with the latest suspension in 2019) has become a headline with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stating that he would oppose raising the debt ceiling. Put simply, if Congress doesnt get their act together it would be catastrophic for the US economy. Despite their refusal, Republicans agree that a default must be avoided. On Wednesday, McConnell said, America must never default -- we never have and we never will, as he then voiced his opposition to a bipartisan increase.

Here is a very informative article by the Associated Press: [https://apnews.com/article/debt-limit-explained-8c9cbcd3d0c4a8fe989a0110f5159f7c](https://apnews.com/article/debt-limit-explained-8c9cbcd3d0c4a8fe989a0110f5159f7c)

Earlier in the week, Fed officials said that by the end of the year, the economy will have likely hit the substantial further progress milestone indicated last December needed for the central bank to begin slowing the pace of those purchases.

The Fed signaled in their September monthly monetary policy meeting, Participants generally view that as long as the recovery remains on track, a gradual tapering process that concludes around the middle of next year is likely to be appropriate.

Here is the full transcript: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20210922a1.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20210922a1.pdf)

Rick Rieder, BlackRock's chief investment officer of global fixed income said,  ""Though markets have been nervously eyeing the start to tapering for months, it is ultimately ""...likely to have minimal market impact at this stage. This is partly because the Fed has done a decent job of telegraphing when tapering is likely to begin (most market participants believe the announcement will come this year). But more importantly its because the asset purchase reductions are likely to be trivial when seen in the context of how large the fixed income markets are today, and how overwhelming the demand for income has become.""

Stocks traded choppily today as market participants closely monitor development in Washington surrounding stimulus. Though Pelosis self-imposed deadline of 48-hours to reach an agreement came and went, discussions continue.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.08% down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 0.21% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) underperformed the most, ending the day 0.35% down.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg TV that she was willing to keep stimulus discussions open past her Tuesday deadline and said she is optimistic about the progress being made. White House Chief of Staff Market Meadows said on CNBC that negotiators were working hard to get a deal done by the weekend, and that White House increased its offer by another $80 billion to $1.88 trillion.

Despite support from the President and top government officials, questions remain over whether the Republican-controlled Senate, who have publicly disparaged the bill, would vote to advance any deal. Senate Republicans have so far baulked at the high price-tag the proposals. According to an article released by the New York Times, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell privately told Republican senators on Tuesday that he had warned the White House not to strike a pre-election deal with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a new round of stimulus, moving to head off an agreement that President Trump has demanded but most in his party oppose. McConnells remarks, which were confirmed by four Republicans familiar with them, threw cold water on Mr. Trumps increasingly urgent push to enact a new round of pandemic aid before Election Day and came just as Ms. Pelosi offered an upbeat assessment of her negotiations with Steven Mnuchin.

In other news, Senate Democrats successfully blocked the Republicans attempt to pass a targeted $500 billion coronavirus bill, with Pelosi, Mnuchin, and the White House engaged in a desperate attempt to come to a much-needed agreement before the November election. The bill, similar to one the Republicans tried to pass some weeks ago, fell in a 51-44 vote, falling short of the 60 supermajority required. Republicans in Congress argue Democrats have reached for an expensive wish list filled with many provisions unrelated to the crisis. McConnell said the Democrats are engaging in all-or-nothing obstruction as they hold out for a comprehensive deal worth about $2 trillion. In response, Democrats accuse the GOP of failing to recognize the magnitude of the economic and health crisis that is gripping the country. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (Democrat, New York) has called the Republican plan paltry, partisan, and emaciated. 

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she has a prospect for an agreement with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on a coronavirus stimulus package, but floated the possibility that it may not come together in time to pass both chambers before the Nov. 3 election. There will be a bill. The question is: is it time to pay the November rent  my goal  or will it be shortly after. I want people to know that help is on its way. It will be bigger. It will be better. And it will be retroactive. It seems the chances for any sort of short-term stimulus before November 3 are slipping away.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, March 26, 2021**

Stocks gained on Friday, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) recordings its best day in three weeks as, as market participants digested tepid inflation data in the US. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed the day 1.5%, the Dow Jones closed (DIA) 1.39% up and the SPY closed 1.59% higher.

For February, at least, core personal consumption expenditures  the Federal Reserves preferred inflation gauge  rose just 1.5%, coming in well below the central bank's 2% target. The report helped allay concerns of a rapid rise in inflationary pressures forcing the Central Bank to tighten monetary policy sooner-than-expected. Moreover, the Fed has been consistent in their reluctance to act prematurely. Charles Evans, President of the Federal Reserve in Chicago said even  a jump in inflation of six months is not nearly enough to warrant a pivot on monetary policy by the Central Bank. Yesterday, in an interview with NPR, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell doubled down in his assertion that the Fed remained strongly committed to targeting 2% average inflation over time, and said that any eventual pullback in Fed support would be done ""gradually over time, and with great transparency.""

The 10-year benchmark Treasury yield continues to rose today to 1.68% at the time of writing. The Treasury yield rises with the expectation of economic growth as the US begins to open back up. Gabriela Santos, JP Morgan global strategist said, We think long-term bond yields are just in a pit stop here in whats going to be a multi-year move higher. Ultimately, we do continue to think that it will harm the more speculative or expensive parts of the market like tech and really benefit the more cyclical \[sectors\] and especially the parts of the market that can benefit from a steepening yield curve. We agree, after the outsized growth in growth and tech stocks last year, its time for cyclical and reopening stocks, many that remain well below pre-pandemic levels, to recover as the economy gradually reopens.

Despite a volatile year so far, the energy and financials sectors have been leading gains in the S&amp;P 500, extending a run of outperformance against tech and growth shares in 2021, underscoring the increasing rotation that is occurring into stocks poised to benefit from the opening of the economy. Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. 

**Highlights** 

* U.S. crude oil prices rose after dropping by more than 4% on Thursday as additional virus-related lockdowns in Europe and Asia raised demand concerns, outweighing supply issues due to an ongoing blockage of the Suez Canal. 
* Consumer sentiment firmed in March, rising to the highest level in a year as stimulus checks and quicker-than-expected vaccinations gave Americans hope of a strong post-pandemic recovery, according to an analysis done at the University of Michigan
* WeWork, the embattled office-sharing company, agreed to a merger in order to go public at a valuation of around $9 billion, a far cry from the $47 billion valuation the company was worth in 2019. Japanese bank Softbank remains the companys largest backer.
* NIO became the latest carmaker to temporarily suspend production on Friday as a result of a global semiconductor chip shortage that has led to major problems for car manufacturers across the world.
* The Federal Reserve said that temporary restrictions on bank dividends and share repurchases will end for most banks on June 30 -- subject to how the banks fare during the annual stress tests. Last summer, with the economy reeling from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, the Fed blocked buybacks and capped dividends to recent profits to force the big banks to conserve capital.

"135","2022-04-23",1650675132,"Can FB keep going lower? In-depth analysis","There's a lot of bearishness around Meta right now, and bearish market conditions going into next week. A lot of fair concerns with the company as far as smartphone ad restrictions, slowing growth and overinvestment into the metaverse. Hence analysts project an abysmal 2.51 EPS, would be a 35% decline QoQ. I think there's a case to be made this thing has overshot to the downside. Down another 15% just in the past 3 days on a market downturn/NFLX scare. 

If you look at FB's past earnings and the fundamentals, things look perfectly okay. Last earnings weren't great for a few reasons but not bad either, their revenue and Monthly Active Users made all-time highs. But the big news was that Daily Active Users declined for the first time, from 1.93m to 1.929m.. Yep, a QoQ decrease of 0.05% and the stock dumps $237 billion of market cap in the most cataclysmic fashion possible. 

Now here we are trading at a P/E ratio of 13.63. That is rock bottom for a profitable tech stock which puts up consistent earnings and also has plenty of avenues for growth even if the metaverse endeavor falls flat. At this multiple I'm inclined to believe the concerns are overblown for the future of this company. Even in the depths of the 2008 recession, ad spending only went down 13%. Wouldn't necessarily expect that again, and ad spend is still rotating away from traditional media. All indications say ad spend is fine in Q1 2022, at least.

Here's a rarely mentioned fact, India is FB's largest democratic with roughly 329m monthly active users vs. 179m in the US. So FB has all this selling pressure from recession concerns, when India is the fastest growing major economy in the world. May face headwinds from global downturn, sure. But nice to see the INDA (India ETF) holding up really well atm, just as another data point. Also, FB has little to no headwinds as far as supply chains or inflation like other names. They're positioned well going into an economic downturn. Another fun fact, people tend to value their relationships more when money is tight, and spend more time socializing. Also more time at home. FB could perform well in this environment. 

So overall, could we miss the already terrible 2.51 EPS projection and dump more? I guess, but we have a major trendline at $160. Would be very surprised if it dumped beyond there even on bad earnings. How much more do you want it to dump at this multiple? For reference, NFLX was at a 31 P/E ratio before earnings, now 19. FB at 13.63? Hard to see a lot of downside, it's not a utility stock.. It still has some growth potential, but basically all of that has been priced out now. Already trading well below the P/E ratio of SPY at 21 and QQQ at 28. Lots of upside potential, limited downside. Below $160 is concerning in the short-term. 

So for all you FB bears out there, can you find me another large cap stock like this with global growth potential trading at a P/E less than 14? Or any profitable large cap tech stock? Please show me how wrong I am that this stock is underpriced. I'm always open to see more data or learn something new.

They're expanding to Mexico, just realized wife got one of their cards few months back so they're expanding and are growing profits each quarter. 35b market cap.
2. COCO is the maker of Vita Coco which is sold in Costco. Have seen loyal fanbase swear by this drink after researching about it. Lately, have been seeing Coconut water is on the rise.  Just saw documentary of fast growing export from countries like Sri Lanka. With 1.6b market cap, am thinking this company could be bought out in the future and Coconut water is growing trend.
3. BRZE Braze company is interesting, helps companies push notifications to their customers through various platforms and is introducing AI generative marketing based off data collected from customers. CFO says will be profitable by 2024 Q4. 4b market cap, operates with subscription based model and growing rapidly their accounts with $500k+ subscription.
4. SOFI bank is another interesting pick, not because Reddit but actually seeing commercials for this bank and is reaching me by actual marketing efforts now so real world implications. 8b market cap, chase bank is 440b so even x10 is still just 80b market cap which is more realistic imo if growth continues. Younger audience which supposedly will grow into their wealth.

I'm not considering buy now, when fear and greed index takes another nose dive and another crisis starts I'd like to then DCA into these companies. The most famous art dealers will buy hundreds of paintings and hold long term, it's only a handful which actually explode immensely in value.

Rational is don't need to get everything right, but finding a 10x with a company near 5b market cap is more realistic imo than expecting Apple to x10 with current 2.7t market cap. There's also too much concentration in these massive behemoths which makes me rather want to invest in ETFs like QQQ and then have few moonshots on the side such as listed.

However, I would recommend to everyone to at least acknowledge that a short squeeze is potentially happening, and could potentially continue to happen. What this means is you should be weary of which Hedge Funds are shorting AMC at the moment, AND WHAT THEIR LONG POSITIONS ARE.

If AMC or GME begin to cause Hedge Funds to get margin called and liquidated, we might be in for a flash crash of some of the biggest named stocks.

"138","2021-02-23",1614083421,"Let's not panic here - This selloff is a healthy market reaction to rising treasury yields","**Disclaimer:** I'm heavily simplifying a very complex topic for the sake of keeping this post brief.

Folks, close your trading app. Take a deep breath. Relax.  This is not the apocalypse. This is not the armageddon.

Before I get into what's happening, here is a bit of perspective: Even with yesterday's selloff, NASDAQ ended at 13,533. I can't see what the index is like pre-market, but QQQ is down 1.35% as I write this. So let's assume it opens 13,350.

That's still 280 points higher than the post-January selloff (low of 13,070). That's also still 462 points higher than December 31st (we closed at 12,888). In %, that's 2.14% and 3.58% higher, respectively.

Now I know that a lot of you are trading on highly volatile stocks (looking at you, CRSR and PLTR), so obviously they are hit much harder than NASDAQ. That's the nature of the beast. Volatile stocks = large swings, both up and down. Welcome to the flip side. I have some of those in my portfolio, and also some defensive and cyclical stocks. It sucks those volatile positions deep in the red. I know how you all feel.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, what's happening?

**Treasury yields are rising.** That's what's happening. There's obviously more to it (I.e.: vaccination seems to be going relatively well, Biden's stimulus, etc.), but that seems to be the catalyst. In fact, the 10-year yield rose to its highest level in the last year, at 1.37%. **That's a good thing:** Rising yields are a sign of economic recovery and increasing economic activity. It's a good thing.

Why are yields rising if interest rates remain low? Because of one of the fundamentals of yields: As bond prices rise, everything else being equal, yields will drop. And the inverse is also true. As bond prices drop, yields will rise. And right now, bond prices are dropping. People are becoming more and more optimistic about the prospect of recovery, with Biden's stimulus and with the vaccination that is (once again, relatively) going well. So they are exiting ""safe"" investments with lower yields in favor of riskier investments with higher yields: junkier bonds, stock market and alternative investments.

Wait, if rising yields are a sign of people exiting the bond markets to go towards the stock markets, why are prices dropping????? Great question, and my answer is twofold: (1) NASDAQ is not even in market correction territory, Chill. It closed roughly down 5% from all time highs yesterday. (2) Look at S&amp;P500 and DIJA. DIJA is a winner in this, and S&amp;P is barely phased.

So back to my explanation, people are leaving bond markets for markets with higher potential returns, and the stock markets is one of them. Now, the reality is that rising yields are not always immediately good for markets, especially overheated markets like NASDAQ: This can spook a lot of investors and cause a selloff, which is essentially what's happening right now. This doesn't mean, however, that the apocalypse is upon us. Remember one of the reasons why the markets have skyrocketed so much in the last year: Actual interest rates, not yields, are near zero, and will remain near zero for the foreseeable future. This is crucial. New bond issuance will still have shit for yields, this isn't changing.

&amp;#x200B;

**What should we do?** That's entirely up to you. I'm no financial advisor. I'm no expert. Take everything I say with a massive grain of salt. I'm no expert. But really, I'm barely doing anything. I'll be taking a page from Cathy's book: keeping a close eye on when this new craze slows down, sell some of my ""safer, less impacted stocks"" to raise cash and buy the ones that were hit hardest.

"139","2021-03-01",1614579141,"Investors beware: $ARKK is a liquidity disaster waiting to happen","I recently got back on Reddit after a long hiatus - the volatility in Gamestop and other names brought me back to r/wallstreetbets and r/stocks.

Lately I have been doing some research on Cathie Wood's Ark ETFs and am quite alarmed by what I am seeing. I am by no means an expert in finance, but I work in finance professionally. I spent 2 years on a long-short equity hedge fund in NYC right after college, and have worked in M&amp;A for an asset management firm for the last 5.5 years. I am intimately aware of how active and passive (ETF) investment products function and acutely aware of the impact that investor fund flows can have on price and performance of an ETF.

In the case of $ARKK and the family of ETFs, it is glaringly apparent to me that all of these ETFs in the last 12-14 months have become victims of their own success. What do I mean by this?

We'll use $ARKK as an example. In the last 14 months, investors (and many of you) plowed money into $ARKK at a stunning rate - $10 billion in 2020, and another $5 billion in just the first two months of 2021. In conjunction with those investor flows, the Ark ETFs have developed what by any industry standard represent HUGE holdings in many of the portfolio companies, as high as 25-30% in dozens of cases. Many of these holdings are illiquid companies that don't trade significant volume on any given day. The combination of low liquidity, huge investor inflows into the ETF, and now enormous ownership stakes in the portfolio companies has had the effect of driving share prices higher. Much of the ETF's performance over the last 12-14 months is not a function of fundamental improvement of the portfolio companies, but a function of the ETF having to buy illiquid equity securities when inflows are positive. This may not be readily apparent to the untrained eye, but it is crystal clear for those with access to industry flow data.

I ran an analysis on the weekly net flows into ARKK over the last 60 weeks, and found that portfolio performance of the ETF was highly correlated with ETF inflows.

***Correlation of 70%***

***R-squared of 0.49*** 

That is to say, the tail is wagging the dog! ARKK has created its own good performance, but not because the companies have grown or fundamentally improved. Nearly entirely the result of the ETF buying.

What happens next?

Last week was a taste of the trouble ahead. When investors sell the ETF instead of buy, in order to cash out the investors the ETF must sell some of the stock in its portfolio companies, except that liquidity or lack of liquidity becomes a much bigger problem when investors are selling and when the broad equity/tech markets have a correction.

The ARKK ETF price has appreciated nearly 350% in a very short time. Now that Cathie Wood represents a big chunk of the outstanding shares within companies that have become overvalued by almost all measures, and trade with very thin liquidity, any meaningful reversal in investor flows (out instead of in) will result in a cascading collapse of the Ark ETFs. If the fund can generate returns of 350% in roughly a year, just imagine what may happen if investors move toward the exits in a much shorter period of time.

As someone who takes pride in my analytical work, and who is concerned about the limited investor knowledge of many people who own Cathie Wood's funds, I would strongly encourage you to do more research. Learn about the companies held by the ETFs. Try to educate yourselves on valuation methods. And please understand that unless you are willing to lose every dollar that you have invested with Ark, you should take some time to reflect on the risks you are taking.

After spending a very short amount of time on this subreddit and others, I am concerned that many people may not be aware of these risks, and unfortunately the small investors in Cathie's funds will be the ones who bear the brunt of any crisis.

As usual with Wall Street, the insiders like Cathie Wood will get huge payouts and the little guys will get to hold the bag. It is not widely known, but good food for thought that Cathie has sold a chunk of her company to American Beacon. In recent months there were changes to these ownership arrangements that are not publicly known. Whatever happens, Cathie Wood will be just fine, but the small investors may not be.

Good luck and I hope I am wrong.

***Edit*** - for inquiring minds, the link below is a detailed and succinct overview of some of these concerns from a Fintwit personality.

https://twitter.com/BradMunchen/status/1366028953828270082

***Edit*** - some have pushed back on the analysis and I appreciate the discussion, for additional thoughts on how some of these ETF products (and ETF's in general) can create distortions in the market, there are a few podcasts below that I found pretty worthwhile.

https://www.zer0es.tv/interviews-and-analysis/the-perversion-of-passive-investment/

https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-end-game-ep-3-mike-green/id1508585135?i=1000483139066

***Edit*** - some have suggested I re-create the analysis above on a number of more typical ETF products (great idea) to see if outcomes are similar. Some have also pushed back on the statistical significance of 70%/0.49. In finance if you can explain 49% of the variation using just one variable, it is pretty darn good. Not so good in physics or hard sciences.

In any case, here goes...

Background on methods and sources: Data comes from simfund, and the analysis is simple. We build a ""roll forward"" of the assets under management (AUM) for weekly flow data sets. An AUM roll forward is commonly found in the earnings presentations of all asset managers and is useful for understanding the sources of AUM growth in any given period.

In this case:

A:   Beginning of period AUM        &lt;--- Sourced from Simfund

B:   +/- Net New Investor Flows   &lt;--- Sourced from Simfund

C:   +/- Market Performance        &lt;--- Implied by D less B less A

D:   End of Period AUM                &lt;--- Sourced from Simfund


In this way we can see how many dollars flow into a certain ETF over the period, and how many dollars of market gains in the underlying portfolio took place in the same period. Presumably these two values (B&amp;C) would be more highly correlated when B is large and the underlying portfolio is less liquid - causing upward pressure on prices for structural reasons rather than fundamental reasons, i.e. driven by the ETF and not by growth or fundamental improvement in the portfolio companies, i.e. paying a higher multiple for the same stock for no good reason.

I think my analysis stands... but open to more constructive criticism.

***Edit*** - Criticism of this approach may be that I am using dollar changes in both flows and portfolio returns, rather than periodic percentage changes, however my view is that it is the magnitude of the dollar flows that matters more than percentages when trying to ascertain the impact of illiquidity and investor flows.

***Edit*** - Worthy correction from u/notredwan - I was under the impression that American Beacon was in process on exercising its option to acquire a majority position in Ark as was originally agreed in 2016. Evidently that option was extinguished in December 2020 in a deal where Ark took on debt (and likely warrants) to pay off American Beacon on the option value. Back of the envelope math would have put the option value in the $100-150mm range.

Two new disclaimers:

This is the biggest marketcap drop in one day. To put in perspective, if markets were flat, amazon alone would contribute 0.3% in sp500, 0.63% in QQQ, 1.65% for consumer disc sector. The drop is enough, in theory, to send 1100 dollars to every us household.

 Only 98 companies worldwide (of which 59 is us) have a marketcap of 137 billion+. In terms of marketcap leaders, apple is 2.4 trillion, microsoft is 2.15 trillion, google is 1.8 trillion, amazon is 1.67 trillion. google surpasses amazon in marketcap due to strong surge as earnings beat expectations by more than 40%. amazon missed revenue and guidance was below expectations. this is one of the few times amazon misses earnings, previous miss was in October 2018, and one of the worst % drops for amazon not including 2000,2008 crash. Also jeff bezos fell to 2nd richest after today's drop.

In my opinion, this drop is exaggerated. most of the drop is because of sales dropping and bad guidance, but most of revenue comes from retail. But most of the profit comes from aws and ads, and both of the business has accelerated this year. Retail is low margin business, usually 2-3% whereas 20-30% for ads and aws. so aws and ads revenue is 10 times more valuable. People pay attention to revenue as a whole instead of the segments making the profits. If i would break down segments by importance it would be: 40% aws, 25% ads/other, 35% store. I think the aws/ads accelerating would increase stock price so if store was its own company, it would be a 22.5% drop. this drop is unjustified. I would consider to buy this stock but im more of an etf guy, so i dont have a position.

**QQQ** \- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks. (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft). Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE. (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).

**VOO**/**SPY** \- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&amp;P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VGT**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**. There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.

**IWF** \- This is a Russell 1000 Growth fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn't get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different. Other funds that use the Russell 1000 Growth Index include **RWGV** and **VONG**. I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.  **VONE** and **IWB** use the Russell 1000 Index as their benchmark.  **SPYG** and **VOOG** use the S&amp;P 500 Growth Index for their benchmark and would be similar (but not identical) to **IWF**, **VONG** and **RWGV**.

**IWM** \- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies. Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market. It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.

**VXUS** \- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas. I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future. XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.

**EEM** \- iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF - This one is going to have a lot of crossover with **VXUS**. It is an Emerging Markets ETF with a lot of focus on China. It includes Alibaba, Tencent, [JD.com](https://jd.com/), along with companies like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductors. This one should be a solid performer as long as our trade relations with China remain normal.

**EFA** \- This is another international ETF, but here the focus is mainly on more established companies in Europe and Japan. This is a Large Cap ETF that includes companies like Nestle SA, Roche, Toyota, Novartis and AstraZeneca.

**S*****ector fund ETFs:***

**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies. QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them ""electric vehicle"" funds, as well. No problem if you want to add that, but you'll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.

**ARK** group of funds: **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.

* **ARKG** \- Genomic Revolution
* **ARKF** \- Fintech
* **ARKK** \- Disruptive Companies (broader market)
* **ARKW** \- Internet/computer/technology (Telsa is a top holding)
* **ARKQ** \- Robotics and artificial intelligence
* **PRNT** \- 3D printing technology
* **IZRL** \- disruptive companies based in Israel

**XL series of funds**. Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:

* **XLV** \- Health Care
* **XLK** \- Technology
* **XLY** \- Consumer Discretionary
* **XLF** \- Financial
* **XLU** \- Utilities
* **XLE** \- Energy
* **XLB** \- Materials
* **XLC** \- Communications
* **XLG** \- S&amp;P Top 50
* **XLI** \- Industrial
* **XLP** \- Consumer Staples
* **XLRE** \- Real Estate

**Disclaimer:** The views below represent the opinions of the OP and are supported by research from Benjamin Graham's Security Analysis from 1934 and The Intelligent Investor from 1949, along with Google and Yahoo Finance and public statements from Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham. These investment principles do not constitute investment advice, but rather are general principles one might employ in reaching his or her overall financial goals. *All* investing bears risk, including possible loss of capital.

**#1 Create a healthy balance in your portfolio between risky and less risky investments**

*Furthermore, a truly conservative investor will be satisfied with the gains shown on half his portfolio in a rising market, while in a severe decline he may derive much solace from reflecting how much better off he is than many of his more venturesome friends.  quote from Benjamin Graham*

A conservative investor may have 50% of his or her portfolio in risky assets like stocks and real estate and 50% in less risky investments like US treasury bonds (which you can buy either directly from the US Treasury or through ETFs like Charles Schwab Short Term Treasuries ETF (Ticker: SCHO) as well as through investments in gold (SPDR Gold Trust (Ticker: GLD)) which tends to be a good portfolio hedge against volatile markets and inflation (at least historically).

Benjamin Grahams formula for calculating the percentage of assets that should be in risky vs. less-risky investments is to subtract your age from 100 and invest that percentage of your assets in risky investments (like stocks), with the rest in relatively safer assets like cash and gold. For instance, if you are 35 years old, you might invest 65% of your investible assets (not including savings) into risky assets like stocks and 35% of your investible assets in less volatile assets like cash (USD/euro or another stable currency) and gold. A 70-year-old, on the other hand, would only invest 30% (rather than 65%) of his or her assets in risky investments (like stocks) and the balance in more stable assets like cash (again, assuming the cash is in US dollar, euros or another relatively stable low inflation currency.)

Benjamin Graham formula for proper investment portfolio balance:

100  your age = risky assets (such as stocks), with the balance in less risky assets

Of note, most of us might categorize real estate investments as safe investments (which may be the case relative to stocks). That said, as Benjamin Graham reminded us over half a century before the 2007-2008 Great Recession, *Unfortunately, real-estate values are also subject to wide fluctuations; serious errors can be made in location, price paid, etc.* With most financial assets being highly correlated these days due to the high interconnectivity of markets and economies, there are few truly uncorrelated and riskless assets. Real estate prices are as high as ever in 2021 thanks to over a decade of easy monetary policy, along with a dwindling inventory of available homes for sale in the US.

**#2 Have an emergency fund**

*The unexpected can strike anyone, at any age. Everyone must keep some assets in the riskless haven of cash. Quote from Benjamin Graham*

We never know when emergencies may strike. We might be fired. Our division at work might be cut. Our spouse or child may experience a significant setback. The 2020 Year from Hell and Covid-19 should remind the world and each of us that disaster can strike at a moments notice. We must be prepared for these uncertainties. While volunteering at Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), a patient once inadvertently taught the author of this piece, Henry Gindt, to always expect the unexpected. This particular patient happened to be in the hospital following a heart attack&in his mid-40s&as a marathon runner. (As a side-note, some of the best life lessons and principles can be learned through volunteering. If 2020 taught us anything, it might be that there are plenty of our fellow men and women out there who could use a helping hand. Find a great volunteer opportunity near me.) Emergencies happen all the time in life. Oftentimes these emergencies spill over into the financial side of the house. Vanguard Investments suggests as a rule of thumb to maintain at least 3-6 months of income in such an emergency fund in order to cover things like food, mortgage payments/rent, credit card bills, and ongoing health insurance or COBRA in the event of a lost job. This emergency fund should not be invested except in low-risk securities like US Treasuries.

**#3 Choose ETFs over individual stocks**

*There are two ways to be an intelligent investor: by continually researching, selecting, and monitoring a dynamic mix of stocks, bonds, or mutual funds; or by creating a permanent portfolio that runs on autopilot and requires no further effort (but generates very little excitement). Quote from Benjamin Graham*

Broad market ETFs can curb our emotional impulses to buy and sell to some degree as these broad market index funds are less volatile than most any single individual security. The framework around how we might build an optimal portfolio might be to create balance in your portfolio by 1) conducting ongoing and rigorous homework analyzing stocks (active investor) or by selecting a few ETFs and dollar-cost-averaging your investments into these funds over time (see points below). In the Intelligent Investors prologue, Warren Buffett reminds us that Whats needed is a sound intellectual framework for making decisions and the ability to keep emotions from corroding that framework.

Step 1 might be to determine a fixed split between risky and less risky assets as part of your investment portfolio (perhaps using Grahams formula above based on your age).

Step 2 might then be to select a few US and world market ETFs.

This approach might be thought of as setting your portfolio on autopilot as Graham suggests. Some example ETFs offering broad market exposure to US markets include ETFs under the tickers SPY (S&amp;P 500), QQQ (Nasdaq) and DIA (Dow Jones). You can also gain exposure to global markets and global economic growth through even broader market ETFs and mutual funds from Vanguard (ticker VTI), Charles Schwab (ticker SWTSX), and Fidelity (ticker FZROX). These ETFs can be purchased through whichever financial app you use: You Invest (JPMorgan), Fidelity, E\*TRADE, TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, Ally Invest, or any other.

This simple framework may likely do the trick in meeting your financial goals (as well as outperforming any active portfolio management you might pursue). See also how the KISS principle might relate to other areas of your life.

**#4 If you insist on owning individual stocks (active investor) vs. ETFs (passive investor), create a well-balanced and diversified portfolio**

*Grahams guideline of owning between 10 and 30 stocks remains a good starting point for investors who want to pick their own stocks, but you must make sure that you are not overexposed to one industry. Quote from Jason Zweig*

If you insist on picking your own stocks vs. using a basket of stocks through ETFs, try to have between 10-30 stocks to get the benefit of good diversification and do not choose all of these stocks from the same industry. A well-balanced portfolio means selecting at least 10 stocks from at least 3 or 4 different industries, according to Graham. For instance, you might balance some investments in high-growth technology sectors with conservative non-cyclical companies that likely pay dividends and have stable growth such as the best healthcare and insurance companies (what some think of as boring companies). Experts disagree on how many stocks you must own to have a well-diversified portfolio, but the benefits of diversification tend to experience diminishing marginal benefit as you go over 30 stocks. Additionally, your life becomes increasingly complicated if you are actively managing 30+ stocks. Hedge fund professionals spend 100% of their work time focused on tracking their investments. Do you have time to dedicate 40-60 hours+/ week on researching and monitoring your portfolio? If so, and for advanced investors, including hedge fund traders, you might read Benjamin Grahams textbook Security Analysis. It is quite amazing how few professional investors on Wall Street and elsewhere have ever read Security Analysis. Graham reminds us that:

*There is a close logical connection between the concept of a safety margin and the principle of diversification. One is correlative with the other. Even with a margin in the investors favor, an individual security may work out badly. For the margin guarantees only that he has a better chance for profit than for lossnot that loss is impossible. But as the number of such commitments is increased the more certain does it become that the aggregate of the profits will exceed the aggregate of the losses. That is the simple basis of the insurance-underwriting business.*

**#5 Dont overpay for stocks (or real-estate investments, cryptocurrency or any other investment)**

*The investor should impose some limit on the price he will pay for an issue in relation to its average earnings over, say, the past seven years. We suggest that this limit be set at 25 times such average earnings, and not more than 20 times those of the last twelve-month period. Quote from Benjamin Graham*

Dont overpay for stocks just because momentum is good for the moment. In fact, Graham suggested paying an average P/E multiple of 12-13 across an intelligent investors portfolio with a maximum P/E of 15 for any individual security. While these P/E ratios are likely overly conservative and represent outdated valuation rules of thumb in the era of pre-rapid technology innovation/adoption and hyper-globalization, one shouldnt simply ignore a companys current and future earnings prospects in assigning a value. Benjamin Graham reminds us that the time everyone decides that a given industry is obviously the best one to invest in, the prices of its stocks \[or other assets\] have been bid up so high that its future returns have nowhere to go but down. (See points below on analyzing company fundamentals including both value and growth). If you are investing in some of the latest technology stocks or household name companies like Tesla, Uber, AirBNB, Poshmark, etc., you might notice that the P/E multiple is either non-existent or extremely high. This is because the company is not yet earning much (or any) profit. Instead, the market is valuing the company based on its growth profile which, over time, assuming all goes according to plan, will turn into healthy earnings and profit. However, the second the growth assumptions are tweaked by equity research analysts on Wall St. (or a string of bad news hits the company, its industry or the market overall), the initial rosy valuation assumptions of these high-growth/loss-making companies will swiftly be revised downwards, leading to an almost immediate or rapid decline in value. The collapse in value of your securities and investments will be at least twice as painful as the pleasure from the ride up, according to world-renown psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky. Importantly, never forget that the rosy growth assumptions under which are investing today may experience a sharp reversal when you have ceased actively monitoring these investments months or years later. Even if you choose to become an active investor (rather than a passive investor primarily invested in ETFs), by the time the bad news hits, the damage will already be done due to the rapid price movements following breaking news.

Graham and many other notable investors like Warren Buffett and Seth Klarman, billionaire and founder of the investment firm Baupost Group, often speak of creating margin of safety when making investments by buying significantly below a companys intrinsic value. This built-in pricing buffer creates some wiggle room and margin for when things dont work out as planned, as they inevitably do in both financial markets and life more generally. Graham tells us that If the purchases are made at the average level of the market over a span of years, the prices paid should carry with them assurance of an adequate margin of safety. The danger to investors lies in concentrating their purchases in the upper levels of the market, or in buying nonrepresentative common stocks that carry more than average risk of diminished earning power. In other words, Graham himself speaks to the value of dollar-cost-averaging, where the intelligent investor is consistently buying over time, during good times, as well as during bad times.

The Acorns investment app is an interesting app that can help smooth the average buy-in price to avoid concentrating investments when markets are hot and selling when markets are depressed by trickling in investments consistently every day/week/month without any active engagement&over decades. This dollar-cost-averaging approach is likely a much better approach for most all of us in the long run, particularly those of us with a few decades to go until retirement. Consider using investment apps like Acorns or talk to your investment advisor about dollar-cost averaging your investments each week or month.  **This is NOT a plug for Acorns specifically - only for the importance of dollar-cost-averaging. If you'd like to help the OP develop a competitor to Acorns, I'm all in.**

**#6 Focus on the fundamentals (earnings and growth) assuming you choose to be an active investor as opposed to a passive investor**

*Experience has shown that in most cases safety resides in the earning power, and if this is deficient the assets lose most of their reputed value. Benjamin Graham*

Companies like Amazon, Google and Apple are now worth over $1 trillion each as their earnings power is so solid and market dominance so secure (for now). In the case of Google, for example, the company prints billions of dollars annually from Google Ads alone. When selecting individual stocks, focus on the earnings power and repeatability of those earnings in a normal year (normalized earnings). Also, pay close attention to the companys growth prospects. Growth is a much more important factor in the 2020s due to the current pace of globalization compared with Benjamin Grahams era where markets werent as interconnected and the United States market offered nearly all the great investment opportunities in his day.

Grahams formula for selecting growth-oriented companies (as opposed to value-oriented companies below) is Value = Current (Normal) Earnings × (8.5 plus twice the expected annual growth rate), where the annual growth rate can reasonably be expected from the company for at least 7 to 10 years. This formula might be revised to reflect current growth and technology assumptions. However, having some sort of investment formula (which perhaps you develop) as a guide might come in handy as much today as it did in 1949. If you can hold yourself to this investment formula, you might avoid serious mistakes. You might also stress test each of your stock investment ideas (or investment formula) with 2-3 trusted advisers to gain an outside view.

For more value-oriented investments, Graham lists 7 key requirements:

1. Adequate size
2. Sufficiently strong financial condition
3. Continued dividends for at least the past 20 years
4. No earnings deficit in the past ten years
5. Ten-year growth of at least one-third in per-share earnings
6. Price of stock no more than 1½ times net asset value
7. Price no more than 15 times average earnings of the past three years.
8. In developing your own formula for investing in todays markets, you might take some example key requirements above and revise them to fit your investment strategy.

**#7 Have patience. (This is hard. Very hard. Extremely hard.)**

*A defensive investor runsand winsthe race by sitting still. Patience is the fund investors single most powerful ally. Quote from Benjamin Graham.*

When markets are panicking and you dont know what to do, do nothing. Panicking only makes matters worse as you try to sell or make other rash decisions. The Intelligent Investor is patient and knows that the best investment holding period is forever, followed by a lifetime, followed by 30 years, followed by 10 years, followed by 3-5 years, followed by at least 1 year in order to reap the capital gains tax benefits (see point below on optimizing taxes). Benjamin Graham reminds us that *In the financial markets, the worse the future looks, the better it usually turns out to be.*

**#8 Set rules for when to sell**

*Reversals \[of fortune\] will have more meaning for the active than for the passive investor. But they suggest that even defensive portfolios should be changed from time to time, especially if the securities purchased have an apparently excessive advance and can be replaced by issues much more reasonably priced. Quote from Benjamin Graham*

*It may be assumed that a stern and uniform policy of selling at 25% or 30% profit will work out best as applied to many holdings. Quotes from Benjamin Graham*

Set rules for when to sell such as after a certain time period has elapsed (say 2-5 years) or profit goal or loss limit has been reached. Instituting rules such as selling all securities at a 30%/50%/100%/3x etc. profit (or at a 10%/30% loss to cap losses) can take some of the emotion out of investing. Make sure whatever specific goal you set when making the investment in a stock(s) or other security aligns with your long-term financial goals. Setting rules on the front-end that align well with your overall long-term financial goals should include setting rules for both downside scenarios and upside scenarios. The best financial and investment apps are pretty good about making it easy to set stop losses or sell at a predetermined profit level. We might also be reminded by Benjamin Grahams most famous student, Warren Buffett, about the two key rules of avoiding loss of principal so that you can stay in the game: #1 Dont lose money and #2 See rule #1.

Some of the best online trading apps and investment apps include Fidelity, E\*TRADE, TD Ameritrade, You Invest (JPMorgan), Charles Schwab and Ally Invest. If you dont have time to do the arduous and consistent research required on the 10-30 stocks in your balanced investment portfolio, a better approach is to use the Acorns app which automates your investments into the most well-known and diversified ETFs from Vanguard.  **If you'd like to help the OP develop a competitor to Acorns, I'm all in.**

**#9 Dont chase the latest shining star**

*What you dont do is as important to your success as what you do. The lesson is clear: Dont just do something, stand there. Its time for everyone to acknowledge that the term long-term investor is redundant. A long-term investor is the only kind of investor there is. Someone who cant hold on to stocks for more than a few months at a time is doomed to end up not as a victor but as a victim. Quote from Benjamin Graham*

Dont jump on the latest stock or other hot investment bandwagon. If the stock is front-page news all over the world and is skyrocketing, it is 9 times out of 10 too late to get onboard for profit. Momentum plays a big role in stock prices in the short term, but over the long run, a company is valued on its earnings and growth trajectory. Oftentimes, technology companies receive such a lofty valuation based on future growth expectations, such as Teslas historic rise in 2020. If growth does not end up meeting these expectations, you can expect a companys publicly traded valuation to decline as quickly as it rose. 

**#10 Ignore the charts**

*If you look at a large quantity of data long enough, a huge number of patterns will emergeif only by chance. Quote from Benjamin Graham*

The only metrics you should be focused on are the fundamentals of the company (earning and growth). Many investors these days are fixated on the charts such as various moving averages. These are all non-sense. These charts are simply reflections of the latest emotion of an entire market consisting of billions of people reacting to the latest positive or negative news. Ignore these human emotions masquerading as indicators and charts. They will not serve you well in the end. Benjamin Graham refers frequently to the stock market as the emotional and moody Mr. Market, which is subject to the daily whims and emotions of&the people trading the stocks on the market. Are there market dislocations and can some investors make money by spotting those temporary market anomalies and market dislocations? Sure. Can they do so repeatedly and consistently over time such that they beat the overall stock market? Many experts think not. In fact, Barrons research showed that hedge funds only beat the market by an average of 1.5% annually over the past 20 years. After subtracting the 2% annual fees these investment managers charge the pensions and endowments which are their own investors, they lose money. Think you can beat the average hedge fund manager? Statistically, its possible. For a while. Until you dont. See later points on automating portions (or a substantial amount) of your investments. As humans, we all like crunching data and seeking out patterns. Its usually not wise in the realm of public markets investing.

**#11 Look for large undervalued companies**

*""The market is fond of making mountains out of molehills. If we assume that it is the habit of the market to overvalue common stocks which have been showing excellent growth or are glamorous for some other reason, it is logical to expect that it will undervaluerelatively, at leastcompanies that are out of favor because of unsatisfactory developments of a temporary nature."" - Quote from Benjamin Graham.*

Hunt for true bargains. Graham defines a true bargain as a company that is currently trading at a 50% or more discount from its inherent/intrinsic value. For instance, Facebook was a good example of an interesting investment opportunity for growth at a reasonable price (GARP) during the major market crash in 2020 and when the company made global headlines for its privacy issues. See the referenced two major dips on Google Finance here. The global food giant Wal-Mart provides another good example of a value-oriented investment with a healthy long-term dividend. Wal-Mart was trading in the low $80s/ share in 2018 when Amazon was soaring. Check Wal-Mart today. As conventional wisdom goes, markets tend to overcorrect during negative news cycles and overbuy/overpay when the sky is blue, the sun is out and wind behind the sails is plentiful.

**#12 Expect market volatility (and have nerves of steel during this time)**

*In any case the investor may as well resign himself in advance to the probability rather than the mere possibility that most of his holdings will advance, say, 50% or more from their low point and decline the equivalent one-third or more from their high point at various periods in the next five years.*

*In the end, how your investments behave is much less important than how you behave. Quotes from Benjamin Graham*

Manage your emotions. If you cant (like most all of us), read the following two points on micromanaging investments and market volatility. Re-read them. Then, re-read them again. Jason Zweig points to the work of world-renown psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, whose studies have shown that we experience negative emotions and pain from loss twice as intensely as we experience joy and pleasure from gain. This loss aversion principle applies not only to financial markets but to many aspects of life. You might check out Daniel Kahnemans bestseller Thinking Fast and Slow to dig deeper into these psychological forces that influence how we react and behave every day. Markets will inevitably decline, sometimes by as much as 50% or more. Remain focused on the long-run by having nerves of steel. Remember the 2007-2008 Great Recession and the 2020 Covid-19 Global Pandemic and analyze those stock market dips in the context of current market prices. Graham reminds us that:

*For indeed, the investors chief problemand even his worst enemyis likely to be himself. (The fault, dear \[investor/Brutus\], is not in our stars\[and not in our stocks\]but in ourselves&.  William Shakespeare). We have seen much more money made and kept by ordinary people who were temperamentally well suited for the investment process than by those who lacked this quality, even though they had an extensive knowledge of finance, accounting, and stock-market lore.*

**#13 Do not micromanage your investments**

*It is for these reasons of human nature, even more than by calculation of financial gain or loss, that we favor some kind of mechanical method for varying the proportion of bonds (less risky) to stocks (more risky) in the investors portfolio.- Quote from Benjamin Graham.*

Avoiding micromanaging of investments ties into the point above on keeping emotions in check. You might focus on rebalancing your portfolio between risky and less risky assets 1-2 times/ year rather than choosing new stocks endlessly throughout the year. Graham proposes a rule of thumb for maintaining a split in your portfolio of 100  your age in risky assets (like stocks) and the balance in less risky assets like treasuries, cash and gold. Spending your time balancing and rebalancing your investment portfolio 1-2 times a year, for instance, is likely far better than readjusting your portfolio daily or weekly, which is a common investment mistake made by the best of us and is largely based on human emotion and current market news and headlines rather than based on sound financial analysis.

Dont overreact to the headlines. Everyone sees the headline and sells or buys depending on whether the headline was positive or negative. Challenge yourself to take a strong mental note (or better yet keep a log of your notes) and consider the particular headline in light of all the other news and headlines the next time you rebalance your portfolio (at most 1-2x/ year). Ben Graham reminds us that *most businesses change in character and quality over the years, sometimes for the better, perhaps more often for the worse. The investor need not watch his companies performance like a hawk; but he should give it a good, hard look from time to time. Basically, price fluctuations have only one significant meaning for the true investor. They provide him with an opportunity to buy wisely when prices fall sharply and to sell wisely when they advance a great deal.* In other words, you might take a contrarian approach when looking for interesting market dislocations.

**#14 Automate. Automate. Automate.**

*It is for these reasons of human nature, even more than by calculation of financial gain or loss, that we favor some kind of mechanical method for varying the proportion of bonds to stocks in the investors portfolio. Quote from Benjamin Graham*

*If your investment horizon is longat least 25 or 30 yearsthere is only one sensible approach: Buy every month, automatically, and whenever else you can spare some money. Quote from Jason Zweig.*

Choose a financial investment app like Acorns to mechanize and automate the process of investing. If you are starting out investing in your 20s or 30s, you will have plenty of decades for the markets to work for you. You might trickle in however much you can afford in order to make these investments consistently. The beauty of Acorns is you can set up a recurring investment (of say $100 per week) without having to actively remember to invest daily/weekly/monthly. A unique feature of Acorns is that you can link your credit cards so that for every purchase you make, the purchase amount is rounded up to the next dollar and instantaneously invested in a broad set of index funds. Further, you can decide whether the funds are invested in broad index funds falling into a conservative, moderate, or aggressive approach, depending on your age and financial goals. Benjamin Graham explains the concept of dollar-cost-averaging (the approach used by the financial investment app Acorns), in the following way\*\*:\*\*

*The third is the device of dollar-cost averaging, which means simply that the practitioner invests in common stocks the same number of dollars each month or each quarter. In this way he buys more shares when the market is low than when it is high, and he is likely to end up with a satisfactory overall price for all his holdings.*

*You might also consider using a personal financial app like Mint from Intuit or Plaid to manage your overall financial goals, which offer tools and features like a personal budget planner, credit monitoring, and track my spending.*

**#15 Never forget the reason for investing in the first place**

*After all, the whole point of investing is not to earn more money than average, but to earn enough money to meet your own needs. Quote from Jason Zweig.*

Many investors focus on either getting rich or making more money than their peers or simply beating the stock market averages. These investors tend to lose sight of the overall purpose of investing. Focus on your unique goals for investing as it relates to your unique financial situation. Are you trying to meet your and your familys financial needs for this month or this year? Are you on the verge of retirement? Are you in the prime of your career? Each persons financial situation is unique because the timing of our financial needs depends on our situation. However, all of us might benefit from reminding ourselves why we invest in the first place. Separate from investing, its also worth considering how much of our time were willing to trade in order to earn money, oftentimes to buy things we dont need to impress people we dont care about impressing in the first place. Time is the most valuable asset for anyone. Invest as much as you can in yourself through ongoing education, learning, and spending time with friends and family. In terms of your financial goals, specifically, see the point above on finding and using one of the best personal finance apps like Mint or Plaid.

**#16 Understand the definition of the phrase long-term investments (as well as long-term financial goals)**

*Psychologists have shown that humans have an inborn tendency to believe that the long run can be predicted from even a short series of outcomes. Quote from Benjamin Graham*

Try to think about the long-run in blocks of 10/20/30/50 years from now, depending on your age. The two most glaring examples of short-term market disruptions in the context of true long-term investments or long-term personal or financial goals might be the 2007-2008 Great Recession or the 2020 Covid-19 Global Pandemic (see also WHO). While both crises were undoubtedly severe during the time, markets typically recover within a decade or less. Why is this? If you consider that the stock market is simply a marketplace for buying and selling ownership interests in companies and that you can own a small sliver of the US or world economy through broad market ETFs, it might not be surprising that over time there will be growth. The aggregate of companies nearly always grows over time because the global population of people is growing and collectively building and creating new cities, companies, patents, inventions, ideas, etc. Companies routinely collapse and fall out of the various stock market indices while other companies soar. Some recent examples include Tesla being incorporated into the S&amp;P 500 in 2020 on the one hand while GE was delisted from the S&amp;P 500 in 2018 as the last of the original members of the exchange and replaced by Walgreens on the other hand. Walgreens itself may ultimately fall (or be diminished) due to competition from Amazon, which is rolling out a healthcare platform of its own with online pharmacy delivery following the acquisition of PillPack.) You might track how some of the best consumer startups from 2021 or social media 3.0 startups are doing in the year 2030. Some of these companies may appear on the Nasdaq and be household names. Others might be totally forgotten. These concrete examples of market forces represent the most authoritative definition of American capitalism or American innovation. One of Henry Gindts colleagues characterized the United States as the largest business incubator the world has ever known.

You can gain exposure to this collective economic growth in the United States through broad market ETFs like SPY (S&amp;P 500), QQQ (Nasdaq) or DIA (Dow Jones). You can also gain exposure to global economic growth through even broader market ETFs and mutual funds from Vanguard (ticker VTI), Charles Schwab (ticker SWTSX), and Fidelity (ticker FZROX) which all track the collective global stock market and have close to zero fees. Benjamin Graham tells us that the intelligent investor has no interest in being temporarily right.

**#17 Tax optimize by holding investments for at least one year to reap benefits of the lower capital gains tax rate**

""*Our new Constitution is now established, and has an appearance that promises permanency; but in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.""  Quote from Benjamin Franklin in 1789*

The long-term capital gains tax rate for 2020-2021 is 15% for most single tax filers, but is 0% if annual income is below $80,000 and 20% if annual income is over $441,450. See the IRS page on capital gains for more detail. Aside from incurring high transaction costs from daily (or otherwise frequent) stock trading, when you sell an investment prior to holding that investment for at least one year, your profit will be subject to your typical income tax rate rather than the lower capital gains tax rates above.

Once this drawdown started, he put his entire net worth into more and more increasingly risky picks to try to break even, since he believed in David hunter's ""melt up"". eventually he was stuck with his entire net worth into TQQQ, trying desperately to just ""break even and get out of this scam system"". every day this user was having a mental breakdown. 

recently he said he was buying more TQQQ on margin. he said if QQQ went down by 2%, he'd be entirely liquidated. he said he didn't care because he'd kill himself. the entire discord went into a group call with him and tried to convince him to sell instantly at market open since this was a dead cat bounce but this user insisted it was the bottom and that ""we are off to ATH by EOY like David hunter says"". 

today, QQQ fell by that dreaded amount and more. he posted saying he didn't sell because he thought the gap up today in the early morning was continuing. he said he's gonna do it tonight since QQQ is most likely staying down.

"148","2020-06-15",1592249940,"I'm happy to admit that I'm a total idiot","I'm not trying to pass as a genius or savvy investor at all but most of my positions have been up. I started investing in mid June 2016 and there was a time I dipped into 3x leveraged ETFs like JNUG hoping to make quick bucks. I failed and lost a bit of money (about $3000). Back then I read charts like crazy, trying to predict the trend, looking to the Fed minutes, etc. Guess what? One day I was sure that my positions would go up and when the Fed released their statement, it went down.

I was sick of it. In the very beginning, I invested in AMD, NVIDIA, APPLE, and TWITTER. During all that time I toiled over fundamentals, charts, etc, those stocks steadily climbed. I realized had I not trying to get rich quick, I would be in far better position with those simple blue chip stocks. 

So I changed the way I invest.

I stopped paying too much attention to the news. I stopped reading annual reports, I don't care what the fundamentals are, I wouldn't give a damn if the apocalypse hit tomorrow. Candlesticks, earning, financial statements are all meaningless.

I buy and DCA (Dollar cost average) everything. Every paycheck I set aside a certain amount and put into stocks and ETF

This is my current portfolio

AMD, NVDA, APPL, MSFT, VOO, VTI, SPY, SCHG, VGT, XLK, FINX, QQQ, QTEC, FTEC, ESPO, SMH, MGK.

If you think ""ha, this idiot actually bought SPY and VOO, they are the same shit""

Yes, that's why I admitted I'm an idiot. Perhaps a lucky idiot. The only stock that I lost money is SQ. I bought it at all time high in 2018 and the stock went nearly sideway in 2019 so I sold it at a loss of $200 and invested that money into something else. All of my positions have been going up.

Sometimes I tried to dabble into options trading after seeing mad gains from wallstreetbet. 

The main problem: again, I'm an idiot. A happy idiot in fact. No matter how much I read/watch YT videos, I don't understand theta, delta, exercise, short leg, long leg, time value, intrinsic value, strike price. Ok, I do understand the definitions but I don't know how they can connect to each other to make me money. 

So I dropped option trading completely, not even attempt to do anything about it

My portfolio hit all time low on March 20 at -17.33%, today it hit all time high at 18%. It climbed about 40% for the past 3 months

All due to DCA. I steadily put money into stock every 2 weeks. I don't care if the market hit all time high or all time low, I buy. When RH crashed and everyone freaked out, it didn't affect me one bit. 

When I read the story about that guy who took his life over 700k loss, I realize it could be me had I not learn anything from the early $3000 loss. I don't do well with stress. I want to go home after work at night, check my stocks for 5 minutes, eat something, fap, and go to bed. I don't ever want to stress out every minutes of my life over things I can't control: the market.

I don't try to give anyone advice because I'm still a learner. All I ever do is to expand my portfolio and put some more money every paycheck.

But before you buy any book or subscribe to any stock-picking or teaching service, do you realize that stocks picked by a monkey can beat the market?

We in the mid of the secular bull market","Its very interesting reading over this and other subs with influx of new people wasting their time and energy on trying to explain daily move without looking at the big picture , the biggest difference you will spot between people with and without experience is that after you been investing for a while you stop carrying what is happening and why day to day or even month to month  , you just accept randomness of market with millions buyers and sellers who all have their own goals and plans and insensitive doing their thing and sometimes they buy more and sometimes they sell more, life goes on.

So , lets look at the big picture to understand why we going to have a crazy bull run thats been happening since 2013 ( some argue 2020 was reset , but imo it was event driven violent pullback and rally back with same intensity , I would argue until we go down -20% and stay there for couple month bull market is not dead )

1.

XLF , financial ETF, you know, boomer shit like banks etc no sexy SQ or PayPal fin tech,  we broke off 2007 top we had pre 2008 explosion when ETF still had BS and Lehman , spreads benefits banks and good for profits and if the banks are making money its good for market , I dont think we ever had a serious market issues if banking sector doing good 

2. Euro 600

STOXX 600, dead money for 20 years and we finally past 2000 peak , could be false breakout but we shall see, euro full of boomer shit like banks and old economy companies , I am not super bullish on them but why not own them at cheaper valuation then USA ,half the people who jerk off to Warren B would love to try to dumpster dive  and pick nuggets or just buy who basket 

3. Japan and emerging markets 

Both outperformed sp500 in 2020. Japan , out of all indexes , hard to be bear when even that part of world working 

4.  QQQ

 Rising rates are bad for tech  bullshit , sure some idiotic things will be killed , sorry if you decided to go all in on car company valued at 1 mil per car sold ever , its probably overpriced but we dont care, find support group where you tell each other in circles how its tech/energy/ self-driving company , for other people exhibit A:

Last rate hike cycle and rates going up, fall 2015 to fall 2018, rates were up 40% on relative basis , QQQ was up 90%+, so tech will be fine but some priced to perfection and overhyped stocks will be killed, oh well , they all did insane 2020, dont feel bad for them 

5.  Absolutely insane amount of Fiscal support for masses
In 2008 we saved banks and let everyone get killed, in 2020 we send people UBI checks , didnt let them get for closed on, expanded unemployment benefits and gave tax breaks for people with kids, it could never be more different then last recession and its hard to be a bear when Americans have the highest savings rate in the history of this country ever with trillions of $$$ of liquidity flying around the world looking what assets to get into 



In the early days of the Twentieth Century, when J.P. Morgan ruled Wall Street, a visitor came to the City. He was a long-time friend of Morgan, a commodity trader from Chicago. He was what might be called a perma bear following the Panic of 1907. No matter how high or low the stock market went, his outlook was pessimistic. Another crash, panic and depression were just around the corner.
This was his first visit to the worlds greatest city. He arrived at 23 Wall Street, and was ushered into J.P.s spacious office overlooking the Exchange on one side and George Washingtons statue on the other.
They immediately began talking about the markets, Morgan being bullish as ever, and his commodity friend being as bearish as ever. J.P., he said, the news overseas doesnt look too good.
A buying opportunity! responded Morgan.
After an hour of friendly disputing about the markets, Morgan invited his guest to join him for lunch. They walked outside and started moving up toward Broadway. As they did so, his friend couldnt help but admire the skyscrapers that dotted the Manhattan horizon. Morgan gave him a tour of the giant buildings, pointing out the Singer Building, the Woolworth Building across from City Hall, the famous three-sided Flatiron Building, and the recently completed Met Life Tower, rising 50 stories high, the tallest skyscraper in the world at the time.
His friend was duly impressed,. He said he had never seen anything like it, not even in Chicago.
Finally, J.P. Morgan stopped his friend and said, Funny thing about these skyscrapers  not a single one was built by a bear!

Stocks never rocket straight to the moon -- they bump up and down on the way. And, when you have a red day like today, there are ways to predict when it's going to bump back up.

Here's a chart of QQQ, which is an index ETF based on the NASDAQ:

[https://i.redd.it/bcm7wpfce2i61.png](https://i.redd.it/bcm7wpfce2i61.png)

The black lines you see are called ""Donchian Channels"". They're one of many ways to find what's called ""resistance"" and ""support"" on a stock -- you can use moving averages or bollinger bands or 100 other things, but it's all going to give you the same thing: a bunch of lines on a stock chart that the price will bounce between.

You can see that the stock market goes up and up and up until it can't take it anymore -- then it goes down. But when it goes down -- unless something really bad happens -- it always goes down to either the middle line or the bottom line, then it bounces right back up again.

There is no bad news today. The market is just bouncing like it normally does.

The market is going to keep dropping until QQQ reaches about $325.48 a share. Then it's going to bounce right back up to where it was keep climbing into new highs.","stocks",559,"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/llykgt/why_you_shouldnt_panic_about_todays_dip/"

Stocks fell after the sell-off accelerated in the last hour of the market, as market participants closely monitored development for a near-term stimulus package and rising coronavirus cases in Europe and the US. 

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 1.63% down. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished the day 1.49% down and the Dow Jones (DIA) ended the day 1.34% down. Stocks finished deep in the red after the last hour sell-off.

Over the weekend, there were several developments regarding a coronavirus-relief package. In comments to reporters in Nevada, Pres. Trump said I want to do a bigger number than she wants \[Pelosis $2.2 trillion proposal\]. That doesnt mean all Republicans agree with me, but I think they will in the end. If she would go along, I think they would too, on stimulus. These comments imply that Pres. Trump is willing to propose a higher number than the $1.8 trillion the White House proposed recently. While Republicans have consistently balked at such a high price-tag, maybe Pres. Trumps endorsement can help move the needle.

In response, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi set a Tuesday deadline for reaching an agreement with the Trump administration to pass stimulus before the November election. She and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, another key negotiator, reportedly continued to have discussions over the weekend and are scheduled to meet again today. Drew Hamill, Pelosis spokesperson said, While there was some encouraging news on testing, there remains work to do to ensure there is a comprehensive testing plan that includes contact tracing and other measures to address the impact on the virus on different communities.

According to data from John Hopkins, there were 57,000 and 48,000 new cases recorded on Saturday. While this is a marked improvement from 69,000 cases on Friday (the highest one day total since late-July) the numbers appear to be stagnating around the 50,000 new cases per day. The South and the Midwest have been the most hard-hit regions.

In Europe, there has been a surge in cases, with health and government officials warning of a second wave and imposing new restrictions throughout the continent. The Republic of Ireland will move into ""Level Five"" restrictions from midnight on Wednesday, the country's highest COVID alert level, for the next six weeks. Switzerland and Italy are imposing a nationwide mask mandate in all public spaces, even outdoors from Monday. In England a three-tier system remains in place, with varying restrictions imposed depending on whether an area is on ""medium,"" ""high"" or ""very high"" alert. London is an area of high alert meaning members of different households cannot meet in indoor spaces and restaurants, bars have a 10 p.m. curfew, and a ban on gatherings of more than six people. In France, nine cities, including Paris, have been placed under a 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew.

Just because someone made 1000% gains on something doesn't mean you are going to make that.

Remember, that the faster any asset climbs up the faster it comes down like a house of cards. If it had no resistance going up, there is no support going down and when such stocks crack, they fall through the roof in a matter of hours, not even days.

Nowadays, you get ads on YouTube every 2 seconds with someone shouting in your face with so called their magic formula where their students make $500-$2000 every trade. Don't fall for these snake oil salesman. If making money were that easy, nobody would work their ass off for years just to buy a house or a car.

Pick up a book and learn the basics of Finance. Fundamentals will help you get a handle of how to start valuing a company. While Technical charts play a role in short to medium term movements of the stock, long term is always going to be based on Fundamentals. Watch Peter Lynch's videos on YouTube, he is an old school investor just like Warren Buffett, but has some really good food for thoughts in his videos.

Needless to say, if you are investing in Crpto be extremely conservative. 10% of your portfolio is too much. Anything more than that, and you lose your hard earned savings very quickly if things go south.

I understand there is a Euphoria when you make quick money, but derivatives like Futures and Options are sure shot way of getting screwed if you don't know what you are doing. Everyone has an itch to make a lot of money in a short period of time, but trust me, losing your original investment is one the worst feeling you can ever have if you earned that money by working hard.

If you don't know anything at all about investing and want to start putting some money into an investment account, buy a broad market based ETF like SPY or QQQ on a regular basis. Think $100-$200-$500/month. Time in the market is always going to beat timing the market.

Lastly, as Warren Buffett said - Rule 1: Never lose money and Rule 2: Never forget Rule 1.

TL;DR: Don't invest blindly in Stocks that some friend/stranger recommended you. Efforts to make money quickly on Stocks, Crpto, or Derivatives (Futures and Options) without understanding the fundamentals and risks, will make you lose your hard earned money and your shirt. If you don't know anything about investing, buy broad market based ETF like SPY and QQQ on a regular basis.","stocks",178,"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r029h7/some_words_of_advice_for_those_who_are_entering/"

The market always feels like the point of no return when we are in these cycles, but guess what, the market bounces back.  Sure, some stocks don't, which is why its wise to stay away from the crap memes and just buy ETFs or super solid companies, because they have shown us they always come back. 

I don't know where the bottom is, nobody knows, it could be today, it could be 2 years from now, time will tell.  What I do know, the market has recovered from WWI, the Great Depression, WWII, Vietnam, 1973 oil price rise, 1987 Black Monday, 1991 Japanese Asset Bubble, Dotcom bubble, 2008 Financial Crisis, Covid?, and we will recover from whatever the hell you want to call this.  

The market is different every time it climbs out, there are winners and losers, but the general market survives.  Buy quality stocks and if you don't know what to buy like 95% of us myself included, buy ETFs like VOO/QQQ/etc... and ignore the rest!

# **Earnings reports and the Fed will test the market rally in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/14/earnings-reports-the-fed-will-test-the-market-rally-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Investors will see whether stocks carry their newfound momentum into the week ahead, as major retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot, report earnings and housing data dominates the calendar.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve may also play a role. Minutes from its last meeting will be released Wednesday, and after Aprils hotter than expected consumer and producer inflation, market pros will watch it closely.
*****
&gt; Central bank officials are also scheduled to make comments, including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida who speaks next Monday.
*****
&gt; Stocks have been volatile. The rally on Thursday and Friday was unable to reverse the weeks heavy losses. The defensive consumer staples, financials and materials were on track for a positive week among major sectors. The worst performers were consumer discretionary, off about 3.7% for the week, and tech, which was down 2.2%.
*****
&gt; Technology shares were among the best performers in Fridays rally, up about 2.1%. Energy was the best performer, up more than 3%.
*****
&gt; Watch it with a certain amount of trepidation, said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. Its not like the things that spooked us this week, like inflation, are going away...I think the fact we bounced at the end of the week is constructive. He added that he still expects the market to move forward with fits and starts.
*****
&gt; But a positive for the market and the economy was the announcement on Thursday from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention that vaccinated people do not need to wear masks.
*****
&gt; Fundstrat co-founder Tom Lee said in a report Friday that he now expects small caps and stocks that were hardest hit in the pandemic, like airlines and hotels, are ready to rise off the bottom.
*****
&gt; He is still concerned about the tech sector, which big investors are using as a source of funds as they rotate into staples and health care.
*****
&gt; # Fed Ahead
&gt; The Fed minutes should basically be a replay of the last central bank meeting. But that was held before Aprils Consumer Price Index was reported to be up a sizzling 4.2% year over year.
*****
&gt; That last meeting also took place prior to the April employment report that showed just 266,000 payrolls, a quarter of what was expected.
*****
&gt; I think the Fed is willing to look through these weird data points. Theyre thinking that one data point is not a trend, said Joseph Song, senior U.S. economist at Bank of America.
*****
&gt; But the markets have been focused on whether any data helps clarify how soon the Fed may start to talk about winding down its bond buying. That would be a precursor to slowly ending the $120 billion a month asset purchase program, and also a signal that it is one step closer to raising interest rates.
*****
&gt; Hogan said when the weak employment report was released, the market view shifted away from the idea that the Fed could discuss tapering its bond buying when it holds its Jackson Hole Economic Symposium in late summer.
*****
&gt; But the market moved back to that view when the hot CPI report was released Wednesday.
*****
&gt; We saw hot CPI, hot PPI, said Hogan, referring to the producer price index. That tells us the Fed could be behind the curve.
*****
&gt; The Fed has said it expects a transitory spike inflation, but concerns it may not be a temporary spike rippled through the market. But Hogan said investors took some comfort from declines in iron ore and copper, down nearly 2% for the week.
*****
&gt; # Retail earnings and housing
&gt; Big retailers report quarterly earnings throughout the week. Walmart and Home Depot will report Tuesday. Target, TJX and Lowes release results Wednesday, and B.J.s Wholesale and Kohls on Thursday.
*****
&gt; Another disappointing data point was Fridays Aprils retail sales, which came in flat with March. But they are still at a high level. Hogan said based on the sales report, retailers should have done well.
*****
&gt; Youre likely to hear the usual suspects are outperforming. It used to be Walmart, Target, Home Depot, Lowes, said Hogan. He said now others have joined the list, like TJX and Gap, and should do well.
*****
&gt; Besides earnings, there is housing data. The National Association of Home Builders sentiment index will be released Monday, and housing starts are published Tuesday. Existing home sales will be issued on Friday.
*****
&gt; Hogan said depending on the data, it may help the homebuilders which fell hard in the past week. He noted that D.R. Horton and Hovnanian were both down for the week.
*****
&gt; The home building index is off 5% for the week, even with it being up 1% [Friday]. This is a red-hot sector that has lots of implications, he said. Whats good for home sales is good for auto sales. Its good for Home Depot and Lowes.
*****
&gt; Homebuilders were part of a broad swath of the market that was bouncing Friday.
*****
&gt; Scott Redler, chief strategist at T3Live.com, said by the end of the week, some of the growth and tech names were trading better, like Facebook and Alphabet.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 held the 50-day moving average, which is constructive, he said.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 came within about a dozen points of its 50-day, which is the average price of the last 50 closes. It is often a level that acts as support, but if it is broken, it can signal a negative trend.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was down about 1.5% for the week at 4,173.85. The Nasdaq ended the week at 13,429.98, down 2.3% on the week.
*****
&gt; The tech sector, which has been under pressure, held its yearly uptrend earlier in the week. Today it felt a little better than the rest of the week, Redler said Friday. It doesnt mean you can go into everything, but you can tell traders are picking away at better acting stocks at these prices.

&gt; # 5 Charts We Are Watching

&gt; Last weeks monthly nonfarm payroll was disappointing, but it usually takes a long time for jobs to come back after a recession, so maybe we shouldnt have been so surprised. In fact, looking at the 10 previous recessions, it took 30 months on average to recover all the jobs that were lost. Given we still have 8 million jobs to make up this time, we could still be quite a ways away from getting the labor market back to where we were pre-COVID-19.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/May-14-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The current bull market has tracked the start to the 2009 bull market nearly perfectly. Be aware that right about now is when the 2009 bull finally took a break, falling more than 16% into the summer, explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. We dont expect that type of a pullback this time, but after an 89% rally, maybe a pullback or consolidation is in the cards.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/May-14-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Copper is breaking out to new highs after consolidating for 15 years. The last time it did that it eventually gained more than 150%. Every time is different, but with the global economy soaring back and demand for copper not ending anytime soon, we expect this industrial metal to continue to lead.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/may-14-chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; We also keep an eye on the presidential cycle. We are now past President Bidens first 100 days and choppy action with a new President in Office is perfectly normal right about now.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/may-14-chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; The financial press has discussed the well-known sell in May and go away market saying, but did you know it actually starts on May 5th? As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, the middle part of May is historically quite weak for stocks as the broadly weaker period begins. The calendar, you could say, isnt doing anyone any favors even if the economy still is.

&gt; # NASDAQ 100 Finds Support

&gt; Our go to leading market index indicator of late, the NASDAQ 100 (NDX), which is tracked by the widely held exchange traded fund (ETF) Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ), may have found some support on Wednesday in the big sell off near 13000. Actually, using our wide chisel-tip Sharpie we would draw this current near term support between the black line support levels in the 13000-13200 range on the accompanying chart.

&gt; While we still do not expect any major decline here, we do not foresee any major upside either over the next six months  the Worst Six Month of the year May-October. We zoomed in and updated a few lines and notations on the charts we presented in our May Outlook and in our NDX Uptrend Broken, Support Under Pressure blog post earlier this week.

&gt; We are rather comfortable with our timely April 22 Best Six Months Seasonal MACD Sell Signal and with our outlook for a more typical Reposition in May period. The Fed can print money faster than the market can decline and more fiscal stimulus is coming down the pike as well as continued fuel from pent-up pandemic demand.

&gt; Look for NASDAQ and NDX to rebound and lead the rally into early July through the rest of its Best Eight Months November-June and the historically strong first half of July in keeping with seasonal market patterns. Though, we do see resistance at the recent April highs near NDX 14000.

&gt; If we do break below this 13000 support level there is support at the uptrend line since the September/October lows around 12900 and 12750, which would be an 8-9% pullback from the April 16 14041.91 closing Doji candle high. Below that are the March lows 12200-12420 which would be an 11-13% correction.

&gt; In our view all the stimulus, pent-up demand and Fed money will prevent any major down draft, while seasonals, valuations, technicals, internals, sector rotation and sentiment will keep a lid on the upside most likely until the fall. Please enjoy a more normal summer.

&gt; # Door is Open For Developed International Stocks

&gt; Weve warmed up to developed international stocks recently for several reasons. For one, the U.S. stock market has staged a tremendous rallythis week notwithstandingsince last March which has prompted us and others to start looking for other opportunities that arent pricing in so much optimism. Valuations, though not great timing tools, are more attractive in Europe and Japan. And we expect the US dollar to weaken which could boost non-US stock returns.

&gt; Another reason to take a closer look at international is the recent resurgence of value stocks. The developed international equity market (mainly Europe and Japan) is much more value-focused than the U.S. market, based on the MSCI EAFE Index and the S&amp;P 500 Index. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the relative performance of value stocks versus their growth counterparts has been well correlated to the relative performance of developed international stocks compared to those in the U.S. In other words, international tends to work when value works.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.13.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; Should strong performance by value stocks continueand we suspect it mightinternational stocks will have their best chance in over a decade to sustain outperformance, explained LPL Equity Strategist Jeffrey Buchbinder. The strength in cyclical value stocks such as financials, industrials and natural resources, coupled with tech sector weakness, gives European and Japanese markets a fighting chance of keeping up with the U.S. as those economies fully reopen.

&gt; We can see how developed international stocks are more value-focused when looking at sector breakdowns for key indexes. As shown in the graphic below, the U.S. equity market (represented by the S&amp;P 500 Index) has a much higher technology sector allocation, making it a more growth-oriented index than the MSCI EAFE Index benchmark for developed international equities. If digital media (think Google and Facebook, which are categorized as communication services) and e-commerce (think Amazon, which is in consumer discretionary) are included in this sector comparison, the technology gap widens even further. In essence, for international to outperform, U.S. technology leadership needs to hand the baton over to cyclical value. That transition has been happening over the last couple months and very well could continue.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/5.13.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; At this point the primary factor holding us back from upgrading our view of developed international stocks to neutral from our current negative view is the pandemic. As Europe and Japan fully reopen and see the accelerating economic growth that the U.S. is seeing now, those markets may be in an even better position to outperform. Until then, we maintain our slight preference for U.S. stocks over developed international.

&gt; # Bullish Sentiment Down Big

&gt; The past week has been one of the worst short term runs for the major indices of the past several months, and sentiment this week is reflecting that negative price action. Bullish sentiment as measured by the AAII weekly sentiment survey took a spill, dropping 7.8 percentage points to 36.5%. Whereas just over a month ago bullish sentiment hit a multi-year high at 56.9%, this week's reading was the lowest since the last week of October.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bull.png))**

&gt; The over 20 percentage point decline in that time was the biggest drop in a span of five weeks since a 22.73 percentage point decline in the five weeks ending February 8th, 2018. In the table below, we show the past 11 periods in which bullish sentiment fell by at least 20 percentage points in five weeks without another occurrence in at least a year. Overall, they have consistently preceded solid runs for the S&amp;P 500 with frequent moves higher that are on average larger than the norm. One and three months later have both seen the S&amp;P 500 trade higher 81.8% of the time and a half year to a full-year out has seen the index lower only one time (in 2007). Additionally, each of the prior instances since 2009 has been marked by the S&amp;P 500 trading higher across all time frames.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bull-Table-b.png))**

&gt; With bullish sentiment lower, bearish sentiment gained 3.9 percentage points. At 27%, it is at the highest level since early February though still a few percentage points above the historical average of around 30%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-Bear.png))**

&gt; That has resulted in the bull-bear spread dropping 11.7 points to 9.5. That is the first single-digit reading in the spread since the first week of February, but it still indicates that overall sentiment remains biased towards the bulls.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051321-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

&gt; While bearish sentiment has only risen modestly, neutral sentiment is flying. After gaining another 4 percentage points this week, neutral sentiment hit the highest level since the second week of 2020. Similar to bullish sentiment, the move higher in neutral sentiment over the past few weeks has been one of the largest in roughly three years.

&gt; # ""Inflation"" Trends

&gt; You know it's getting bad when inflation starts to trend on Twitter, but that's where we find ourselves this morning with the terms '#GasShortage2021' and '#inflation' both trending on our Twitter feed.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-Inflation-twitter.png))**

&gt; On Google, the frequency of searches for the term inflation looks like it's on its own path straight to the moon.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-Inflation-trends.png))**

&gt; These real-time indicators of concerns over inflation also manifested themselves in the 'official' inflation data this morning as y/y CPI surged to 4.2%, eclipsing the prior post-financial crisis highs. Not only that, but if CPI is unchanged on a m/m basis in May (highly unlikely), the y/y reading will climb to 4.3% given the decline last May. If we assume that May's m/m change is the same as the average so far this year, it would imply a 4.8% y/y change.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-CPI-SInce-2010.png))**

&gt; Even assuming that inflation only rises at the average m/m rate so far this year may be conservative at this point. That's because the rate of increase on a m/m basis has now accelerated for six straight months. Going all the way back to the 1940s there's never been a streak that long. Just for some perspective, if CPI increases by the same rate in May as it did in April, headline CPI will clock in at 5.1%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/05/051221-InflationStreaks.png))**

&gt; While the current level of CPI looks very high relative to the post-financial crisis period, from a longer-term perspective, it still has yet to show signs of breaking out from its thirty-year range. Based on the pain from prior spikes, let's hope it stays that way.

&gt; # Small Businesses Growingly Concerned About Inflation

&gt; In today's Morning Lineup, we covered some of the details of this morning's release of the NFIB's monthly survey on small business sentiment. The survey showed rising prices, tight labor market conditions, and overall improving demand.

&gt; The NFIB also surveys businesses on what they consider to be their single most important issues. For the majority of businesses, cost or quality of labor and government requirements or taxes are the most prevalent. In total, 64% of businesses reported one of these as the biggest problem. Meanwhile, the percentage of businesses reporting weak sales as the most pressing issue continues to fall which is indicative of a further recovery in demand. One other interesting decline was in the issue of competition from 'big business'. Only 7% of businesses reported this as their biggest problem which is the lowest reading since October 2017. While up 1 percentage point in April, cost or availability of insurance is also still around some of the lowest levels of the past decade. While that mention of costs has ticked only slightly higher similar to the cost of labor which rose 1 percentage point in April, inflation more broadly is increasingly on the minds of small businesses. 6% of businesses reported higher prices as the biggest issue which is triple the reading from February and is the highest level since August 2013.Click here to view Bespoke's premium membership options for our best research available.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.","stocks",121,"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ncw45t/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/"
"161","2022-05-09",1652076704,"Please stop recommending overcomplicated combinations of ETFs to new investors. It doesn't have to be that hard!","I'm going to target Vanguard funds because I see 'mistakes' (more like poor aesthetics) with these funds the most. The TL;DR is this graphic I made: [Figure 1](https://i.imgur.com/sPrFT7D.png).

**Here is your Menu:**

- US Large cap = Burgers (VOO)
- US Small/mid cap = Drink (VXF or VB or similar)
- All US Stocks: Burgers/Drink (VTI)
- Ex-US stocks: Fries (VXUS)
- The whole globe of stocks = Burgers + fries + drinks (VT)
- Bonds = Ketchup Sauce (BND)
- Top 100 US Large Cap minus Financial Services = just the juicy patty (QQQ)
- Maximum diversity, level 9000: Burgers/drinks/fries/ketchup, also known as a Target Retirement Date Fund

**Mistake 1:**  You don't need to buy VTI and VOO. VOO is the burger and VTI is the burger/drink; new investors can do with just one. Have a [meme](https://i.redd.it/bnex5iq2wbh81.jpg) with your meal [credit: /u/Xexanoth].

**Mistake 2:** You don't need VT and VTI; VT is (roughly speaking) burgers/drink/fries. [We're fat enough and don't need another order of burgers/drink.](https://i.imgur.com/cMSfONu.png)

**Mistake 3**: You don't need VT and VOO. A burger/drink/fries combo does *not* need more burgers.

**Mistake 4**: VT is actually not the same thing as VTI + VXUS; check out the ETF overlap website. VT selects a subset of US stocks, so its really 80% of a burger/drink plus the fries. This is not reflected in Figure 1. The consequences are minimal, though.

**Mistake 5**: The newbie investor does *not* need both SPY and VOO. [Two burgers is too much!](https://i.imgur.com/hC5wCGi.png)

**Mistake 6**: The QQQ is the juicy patty inside the burger. We don't need a second burger alongside the isolated juicy patty. So stop recommending QQQ + VTI or QQQ + VOO.

**Mistake 7**: Ketchup sucks. Throw 'em out. (Okay I'm kidding. Except for anyone under the age of 95.)

What actually does make sense to recommend to the new investor? These are all logical portfolios, albeit some are missing some important parts of the meal.

1. VT (Breakfast for a king)
2. VTI + VXUS (good healthy meal)
3. VOO + VXUS (Where's your drink!)
4. SPY + VXUS (Where's your drink!)
5. SPY (Bro, fries??)
6. VOO (Fries!?)
7. QQQ (No bread? Fries? Just the patty? No drink?)
8. QQQ + VXUS (Where's the bread? No drink?)
9. Any combination of these with ketchup (BND)
 
**Caveats:** I'm not saying these portfolios I criticized are *bad,* but having more ETFs does NOT mean you are more diversified, and complexity makes understanding what you are actually invested in hard. I don't think the technicalities of SPY versus VOO matter.

The goal is to cover all of your bases, and minimizing the overlap is simpler and more likely to approximate market caps (which most index fund investors should aim to do). Have a [second meme](https://i.redd.it/yfoun9rn0i981.jpg) from /r/Boglememes; thank you /u/Litestreams.

 I apologize for the ranty tone.


**Bonus**: Any good meal comes with some ice cream afterward. This is AVUV, or small cap value stocks.","stocks",209,"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ulkp5x/please_stop_recommending_overcomplicated/"
"162","2021-06-23",1624483445,"What if you invested in the Linkedin Top 10 Companies to work for each year? I looked into it","For 5 years now (They skipped 2020/Covid) LinkedIn has produced a list of top companies to work for (called various things through the years).  I wanted to see what the (basic) results would be if one invested in the top ten companies.  However, not all of the companies are public or were at the time of the list.  So I skipped those and continued on the list till I had the top 10 public companies.  Also, the formatting is hard so I just included total results for each period and the total for all 5 periods.  I did not include dividends.  

This is not perfect, but just for fun.  I based the results on the begining and ending share price.  It's not weighted in any way, just percent gain (or loss) for each company during that period.  Same for SPY. 

EDIT: Adding QQQ as comparison also as someone requested since the companies are tech heavy.  See below result.

# **The Fed could be a catalyst for bonds, and that could drive growth stocks in week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/12/the-fed-could-be-a-catalyst-for-bonds-and-that-could-drive-growth-stocks-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Bonds could be volatile in the week ahead. If yields go higher, that could make it difficult for big tech and other growth stocks to gain traction.
*****
&gt; Rising bond yields have been challenging growth stocks. Names like Apple, Tesla, and Amazon have been lagging as investors move to cyclical groups that do well in an economic recovery. Even so, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow both closed at record highs Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite was lower.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq, home to big tech, did gain 3% in the past week, but it is down 5.5% over the last month.
*****
&gt; The bond market in the coming week will likely take its cues from the Federal Reserve, which meets Tuesday and Wednesday.
*****
&gt; The central bank is expected to give a nod to much better growth. Bond pros are also watching to see whether Fed officials will tweak their interest rate outlook, which now does not include any rate hikes through 2023.
*****
&gt; # Fed ahead
&gt; The markets have way too high expectations around what the Fed is going to do or say, said Gregory Peters, head of multi-sector and strategy at PGIM Fixed Income. I think the message is going to be consistent.
*****
&gt; He said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is likely to sound dovish and is unlikely to give any time frames on when the central bank will change its bond-buying program or other policy.
*****
&gt; Bond yields, which move opposite price, have been rising on an improving outlook for the economy.
*****
&gt; That trade also showed up in the stock market, with the Dow up 4% for the week to end Friday at a record 32,778. Consumer discretionary stocks, which include retail, were among the best performers, up 5.7%, boosted by optimism that individuals will spend their $1,400 stimulus checks.
*****
&gt; Yields were higher Friday after President Joe Biden said all adults would be eligible for a vaccine by May 1. The 10-year Treasury yield touched a high of 1.642%  its highest level in more than a year.
*****
&gt; It is the key rate to watch since it affects mortgages and other consumer and business loans.
*****
&gt; The economy is going to be unbelievably strong this year  deficit spending, reopening, vaccines, said Peters of PGIM.
*****
&gt; It looks like for next year, all the numbers are being revised higher, he said. So this thing could have some sustainable growth, so I think theres going to be pressure on rates moving higher.
*****
&gt; Bond yields rose sharply over the past month. The rapid pace of the move has made stocks jittery as investors adjust to higher rates. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.16% on Feb. 12.
*****
&gt; # Growth vs. cyclicals
&gt; Over the last month, energy stocks have risen nearly 20%, financial stocks are up 10.2%, and industrials are up 7%. The S&amp;P technology sector is down 5.4% over the last month, and communications services, which includes internet names was up 0.8%.
*****
&gt; Higher rates are a challenge for tech and other growth stocks because those shares are expensive and have high price-earnings ratios.
*****
&gt; When rates are very low, valuations dont matter to people, said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Global Advisors.
*****
&gt; If rates are low, theres no penalty, he said. If rates start to go up, people become much more sensitive to valuations, and thats what weve seen here.
*****
&gt; Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com, follows short-term stock market technicals and trades many of the growth stocks. Lately, however, hes found himself sitting in many value names and cyclicals.
*****
&gt; The names that Im in  Visa, GM, Ford, Macys, 3M. Those have been my biggest winners this week, he said. Its been really hard to make money in Apple, Facebook and Tesla.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq has been hardest hit by the rise in interest rates. Apple was down 0.3% in the past week but down 10.6% in the past month. The S&amp;P 500 finished at a record 3,943 and was up 2.6% in the past week, but is flattish over the last month, up just 0.2%.
*****
&gt; Rate volatility could cause another inflection point in tech, Redler said. Last week, tech hit its reactionary low, and this [past] week it had an oversold bounce. The question is, Was that it?
*****
&gt; Next Wednesday, Powell could be the determining factor, he said. Rates made higher highs and tech is way off last Fridays lows so maybe the market is getting more comfortable.
*****
&gt; Apples stall out is unusual for the tech bellwether. It helped power the markets gains last year.
*****
&gt; Watch Apple because its a little bit of everything. Apple is growth, tech, retail. If anything is doing well, it should be Apple, Redler said.
*****
&gt; # Bond volatility
&gt; There is some important data in the coming week, including Februarys retail sales and industrial production, both on Tuesday. There is also a $24 billion 20-year Treasury note auction on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; The biggest catalyst for the bond market remains the Fed.
*****
&gt; The bond market has been speculating about something the Fed may not discuss after its meeting Wednesday afternoon. In one of its moves to shore up the economy during the pandemic, the Fed allowed banks to hold Treasury bonds without counting them against the banks leverage ratio. This strategy allowed institutions to have more flexibility to use their balance sheet for activities like lending.
*****
&gt; The program expires March 31.
*****
&gt; This is a huge issue basically because you have so much Treasury supply coming and reinstating [the rule] basically makes it highly punitive for banks to own Treasurys, Peters of PGIM said.
*****
&gt; The markets are kind of divided on whats going to happen, he said. I think most experts believe an extension is the appropriate path. You have not heard anything from the Fed on the matter.
*****
&gt; Peters expects the Treasury market to remain volatile.
*****
&gt; I think youre going to see more volatility in a high pressure growth economy with extremely large deficits and an accommodative Fed, he said. I think youre going to see these whippy moves.

&gt; # March Quarterly Options Expiration Week Historically Bullish: DJIA, S&amp;P 500 &amp; NASDAQ Up 10 of Last 13

&gt; Stock options, index options, index futures, and single-stock/ETF futures all expire at the same time four times each year, March, June, September and December. This event is often referred to as Quadruple Witching or as we prefer to call it in the Stock Traders Almanac (2021 page 106), Triple Witching.

&gt; Marchs option expiration week performance is second only to Decembers and has a bullish bias. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have recorded weekly gains in about twice the number of weeks as declines. NASDAQs track record since 1983 is slightly softer with 23 advances and 15 declines, but all three indices have logged gains in options expiration week in ten of the last thirteen years. However, the week after is bearish for DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ. S&amp;P 500 is weakest, down eight of the last nine. Last year as covid-19 began spreading globally and economies began to shut down, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 suffered their worst weekly declines during Marchs quarterly options expiration.

&gt; # Signs of Life in Europe?

&gt; Few equity sectors on earth have been as poor as European financials since the Global Financial Crisis. The sector still sits more than 50% below its 2007 all-time highs, hampered by regulations, low to negative interest rates, and all around slow growth in the Eurozone. However, despite those headwinds, the sector has benefitted from a recent rotation to value, and has certainly been assisted by rising interest rates, a phenomenon we discussed earlier this week.

&gt; Not only is performance for European financials improving in absolute terms, as global equities continue to recover from the worst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but since early October the sector has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by more than 20 percentage points. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the pattern relative to the S&amp;P 500 appears to be on the verge of breaking out of a nearly year-long technical base, similar to where US financials stood just two months ago.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Picture-3.12.21.png?ssl=1))**

&gt; While we dont think European financials are going back to all-time highs anytime soon, remember, the sector still needs to gain 12% from current levels just to eclipse its 2020 pre-pandemic highs, a bar that certainly now seems attainable in 2021. We remain broadly skeptical of foreign developed equities compared to their U.S. counterparts, explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. However, financials are the largest sector within Europe and improving performance and the continued rotation to cyclical value stocks make this a development to keep an eye on.

&gt; For now, we recommend sticking with US financials, which we recently upgraded in our latest Global Portfolio Strategy report, and is now the second best performing sector year to date, trailing only energy.

&gt; # NASDAQ Bounces Off Support As Dow, S&amp;P 500 &amp; Russell 2K Log Record Highs, But Beware the Ides of March

&gt; Weve been tracking the NASDAQ 100 Index ($^NDX) (represented by the ETF Invesco QQQ Trust ($QQQ) as a proxy for the markets technical picture. It contains many of the tech stocks that have been driving the economy and market for the past year through these Covid times as well as for quite a while prior  and likely to do so for some time to come.

&gt; There has definitely been some rotation out of this sector of late as DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 2000 logged new highs today. But we would like to see confirmation with new highs in NASDAQ and NDX.

&gt; The NAS and NDX are still lagging, but todays stronger rally in the techs is encouraging. In this updated technical picture you can see that as the NDX logged a 10% correction from its February 12 closing high of 13807.70 to its closing low on Monday March 8 of 12299.08 it bounced off key support just above 12200 (intraday low on Friday March 5 was 12208.39). Check last weeks technical analysis post for reference to previous support levels that were broken.

&gt; This 12200-level lines up with the October high which is also the high of that W-123 swing bottom pattern we mentioned last week. Back then it was key resistance that we cleared in late-November and early December. It now forms key support and lines up with the uptrend line from the September and October lows we discussed in our Almanac Investor December eNewsletter Outlook just before Thanksgiving.

&gt; However, as the Ides of March are upon us, we must remind you that the end of March has a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously as noted in the 2021 Stock Traders Almanac in the March Almanac and several places on pages 30-39. The Week After Triple Witching is often prone to weakness with DJIA down 22 of last 33 and the last few days often succumb to end-of-Q1 selling pressure. If any late-March weakness materializes it should be a solid buying opportunity for top-ranked April, the last month of the Best Six Months.

&gt; # Versatile Outperformers

&gt; There's still a lot of time left in the day, but the tone of the equity market has been much different today compared to Monday. Whereas Monday saw tech stocks get creamed while cyclical areas of the market rallied, today we're seeing tech stocks rebound while cyclicals lag. To illustrate, within the entire S&amp;P 500 there are just 14 stocks that have so far managed to outperform the index by at least one percentage point both yesterday and today. The table below lists each of those stocks, and looking through them, they aren't the flashy, high-profile names that you always see discussed in the media. Who said boring is a bad thing? In terms of sector representation, there's also no clear trend as eight of the eleven sectors are represented by the list of just fourteen names!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308-Table.png))**

&gt; Below we show six-month price charts of each of the 14 names listed above from our Chart Scanner tool. Here again, no clear technical theme links the stocks together. While stocks like AES, Global Payments (GPN), McKesson (MCK), and Ross Stores (ROST) remain close to six-month highs, others like Ball (BLL), Domino's (DPZ), and Market Axess (MKTX) aren't far from six-month lows.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

"166","2021-09-20",1632172252,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, September 20, 2021"," 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, September 20, 2021**

Stocks plunged on Monday, with the three major indexes having one of the worst-performing days all year as market participants nervously eyed potential ripple effects from the default of the second-largest Chinese real estate company and commentary from the Federal Reserves September Monetary Policy Meeting set to be released on Wednesday. As has been the case for months, market participants are waiting for the Fed to signal when it might begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) fell 1.66%, with the index falling more than 5% from its previous record highs for the first time all year, before somewhat pushing in the last hour of the session. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell 1.93%, while the Dow Jones (DIA) fell 1.78%. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, underperformed the most, closing the day 2.4% lower.

Global markets were rattled today due to fears that Evergrande, the second-largest real estate developer in China with over $300 billion in liabilities, would default on its debt obligations and what the potential implications on the Chinese, and even, global economy may be. If Evergrande were to default, there are fears that the potential damage to Evergrandes lenders could lead to a contagion of the entire Chinese economy. Ming Tan, Director at credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poors said, it was unlikely that Evergrandes default would cause a credit crisis by itself but acknowledges the risk of contagion spreading into the financial sector and the implication that has for other sectors. He said, Banks exposure to Evergrande is quite distributed across the sectors. The main risk for Chinas financial system would be other highly leveraged developers to default at the same time. 

Since I am not a macroeconomist nor proficient in Chinese policy, I dont feel comfortable drawing conclusions on the potential global implications of the default, though personally I do not yet see how contagion would spread globally like in 2008 given Chinas financial sector remains comparatively insular, unlike the US. While comparisons are being drawn to Lehman Brothers, a US bank whose bankruptcy catalyzed the global 2008 recession (which largely did not affect China), I think those comparisons are not correct for a few reasons, though please note this is just my humble opinion.

1. For starters, it is almost a certainty the CCP will aggressively intervene in the case of a default given Evergrande is designated as an entity of systemic importance in China and President Xi has proven to have no problem wielding a heavy hand when its forced. For example, In November 2008 the government introduced a 4 trillion Yuan stimulus package (roughly $620 billion or 14 % of 2008 GDP) for 2009 and 2010. Countless other examples exist. 
2. As I said above, the relationship between Chinese and US lenders is limited at best, unlike Lehman Brothers, which existed in the balance sheets of financial institutions worldwide. This means any damage caused within China has is likely to be contained within its own economy. 
3. Unlike Lehman Brothers, Evergrande still has tangible assets that will be sold off to help settle financial obligations. While their assets arent great and creditors know the company is in trouble, the sale of physical assets will help some. On the other, Lehman Brothers never had hard assets it could sell-off.

In other news, market participants are looking ahead to commentary from the Federal Reserves latest monetary policy meeting set to be released Monday. As has been the theme for the past few months, market participants are looking for signals as to when the Fed may begin tapering the current pace of quantitative easing. As I have said before, I remain uncensored by QE tapering, I think the real test for equities will come when the Fed starts discussing interest rate hikes

My time horizon is 30 years.  I will max the Roth IRA every year and then will be opening a standard brokerage and be trying to invest $1,000 a month.  Im 30 with home and vehicles paid for and no other debt.  I live pretty frugally and have 100k in savings.  Looking to put a portion of it into investing and save a portion for a down payment on my next house.  

Looking to do a set it and forget it portfolio. My money sits in bank and I hardly mess with it so Im looking to do the same but with my investing accounts.  I was planning to do 100% voo but Ive also been recommended schd, jepi, dgro, o, qqq, some others as well.  

Just curious on if I was to grab some of these others how should I divy them up?  Also would it be fine to build both an ira and my standard account the same?

"168","2022-12-27",1672120931,"I Traded 3 Opposing Strategies for 60 Days in 2022 Heres How it Went","I decided to run a short experiment for the last month or two testing out a few different strategies to mix things up. In no way did things scientifically, this was more an exercise to ease some of my recent market frustration and trade in some different new ways. 

Here are the three different strategies and how they performed over the last 60 days

&amp;#x200B;

**Strategy 1 Identifying Potential Trades with Zacks #1 Rank List:**

I used Zack's #1 rank list as my starting point and then filtered using the VGM(value, growth, momentum) score. I would sort to view only the stocks with a rating of A(broke this rule sometimes). I did this a few times and would do some DD on the few companies identified, then determine whether to make the trade or throw it on a watchlist.

Here are a few of my positions and how theyve done:

09/02/22 **HLIT**: 09/02/22 - Communication/tech company sol after a few days for \~9%

09/02/22 **BAESY**: European defense contractor that won some big contracts recently, not much movement exited down -2%

09/13/22 **CHK**: Energy company play that was intriguing, down -8%

08/04/2022 **ESTE**: Another energy play here, held onto this one for 2-3 weeks for a return of \~7%

08/05/22 **HOG**: Always wanted a Harley probably why this caught my eye - exited after 5 weeks for \~10%

08/10/2022 **PPC**: food company, down \~19%+ on this one and still holding

08/16/2022 **SU**: Exited this one at breakeven in early oct, another energy co from Zacks

Total Return: -3%

&amp;#x200B;

**Strategy 2: Trading events with LevelFields**

Trading on events definitely can be risky and my results here are surely biased due to the stocks &amp; events I ended up choosing. I used LevelFields, which I like because it filters down news to the events that are significant and likely to affect share prices and separates that from all the endless news. I set it to track buybacks as well as government contracts, mass layoffs, and some other stuff. This strategy can be rough around the edges, but its been a unique way to find some companies to watch that I mightve never seen.

08/03/22 **RGA**: Health insurance co, dividend increase trade, stock jumped pretty quick, regret selling this one for 4%

08/16/22 **CCRN:** Healthcare conglomerate, bought on news of buyback, sold a bit early here for 7% gain

08/30/22 **FREY**: Traded battery manufacturer on day of news about a $3b contract beginning in 2025. A day or two after took profits at 4.7%

09/07/22 **TASK**: Had been watching taskus for a while, pulled trigger on notification of a big buyback. Up \~5%+ in a few days and took some profits

09/06/22 **COUP**: Tried another buyback play here, was able to get out \~even 0%

9/21/22 **BA**: Bearish event but thought Boeing could rally, took loss at -8%

9/20/22 **PLYA**: Bought this on news(buyback), fell on news, down -9%

Total Return: +3.7%

I enjoyed trading on events and after some early success definitely learned that you have to be careful, as it can just as easily go the other way or an event can already be priced in, or a hundred other things can go wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

**Strategy 3: ""Buying the Dip""**

This strategy is somewhat of my control, and the least scientific. If I noticed the NASDAQ or S&amp;P dropping by more than a few percent (3-5%+), I would buy the dip. I ended up exiting some of these positions but planning on keeping most and continuing to DCA, looking at each trade individually for purposes of calculating return trade by trade.

08/22/22 **SPY**: down 9%

08/23/22 **QQQ**: sold on slight bump, down -2%

08/31/22 **SPY**: Positive few days after buying dip, sold some SPY pushed towards 410, 2.5% gain

When you buy a stock youre buying into the company therefore you want to look at several factors rather than just go with your gut, if you dont look at the following factors then youre better off buying mutual funds or index funds such as VOO and QQQ.

Lets proceed:

1. Pull up the balance sheet for the last quarter, the last year and the last 5 years. Look at 2 categories, assets (money/money making investments)and liabilities (debt/long term expenses)

The total assets should be 2x or more of the total liabilities. The short term assets should also be about 1.5-2x the short term liabilities. If the balance sheet looks good move onto #2, if not move onto the next company.

THIS ALONE CUTS HALF THE STOCKS MOST PEOPLE FEEL LIKE ARE A GOOD BUY

2) Ok so you found a company with a good balance sheet, great! Now lets look at the historical earnings, look at these for the past 10 years. Are the quarterly earnings growing steadily like you want them to be? Or are there huge peaks and valleys showing a more volatile company? Are they trending downwards showing the company is losing money consistently? Or are they flat/slowly growing showing a steady but boring company?

If the historical quarterly earnings over 10 years are steadily growing, thats what you want. So move onto 3)...

3) now lets look at the EPS, this is how much youre paying for the earnings you receive. Lower is generally better, anything over 20PE is considered high. Look at Ford to see an extremely high PE showing an extremely overvalued company, even at $5 a share!

4) Does the company pay a dividend? This means the company pays you money, typically quarterly, to hold their stock. Not always necessary because a lot of high growth tech stocks dont but you make a ton due to natural growth, but a dividend is nice.

This will get you started. If you dont do this for every stock you want to buy then youre just buying stocks based on emotion and what you think looks good on a chart, and you will lose money more often than not.

EDIT: I feel the need to say this is NOT a one size fits all, this is just a good way to find out the value of a company. 

Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Tesla, etc. do not follow this formula, but this can tell you how to price companies like airlines.","stocks",113,"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fj6f6y/this_is_how_you_know_if_a_stock_is_a_buy/"

Stocks traded mixed today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) modestly declining while the Dow Jones (DIA) gained roughly 0.1%. After a volatile beginning to the May, it seems over the past several weeks fears of fast rising inflation causing the Federal Reserve to prematurely tighten monetary policy have tempered. As I have said for weeks, I thought the selloff in the first two weeks of May, that saw the SPY lose 4% in a few days, was overdone, and am very encouraged by the price action in the market recently.

Last week, members of the Federal Open Market Committee once again reassured market participants that they see inflationary pressures as transitory and do not think a shift in monetary policy in the near-term is warranted. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be mostly temporary and that the Fed was not quite there yet when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation. 

Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said there will come a time in upcoming meetings when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that it is going to depend on the flow of data. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.

This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldnt worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.

Looking ahead, market participants are anxiously waiting for the May Jobs Report, which will be released this Friday. This report will highlight the state of economic recovery, showing whether the labor market has managed to further recover following the extremely disappointing April Job Report. Importantly, the job reports are also used by the Federal Reserve to ascertain if the economy is getting closer to its employment goal, at which point monetary support will begin to taper. 

**Highlights**

* Late last week, President Joe Biden unveiled a $6 trillion budget proposal for fiscal 2022, which would include a number of proposals around improving the country's infrastructure, educational resources and health care system and which would be funded in part by higher taxes.

Stocks traded mixed as market participants continue to digest the effects of the sudden unwinding in equity markets by large hedge funds. After the best session in three weeks on Friday, the Dow Jones (DIA) rose while the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&amp;P 500 (SPY) pulled back modestly. 

Bloomberg News reported that Archegos Capital Management, managed by Bill Hwang, the ex-head of Tiger Managements family office and a so-called Tiger cub (the name Wall Street gave to protégés of legendary fund manager Julian Robertson), was forced to sell more than $20 billion worth of stocks following a margin call. Hwang was heavily invested in Chinese tech stocks and American media conglomerates Discovery (DISC) and ViacomCBS (VIAC).  Nomura (NMR) and Credit Suisse (CS) warned that their earnings might take a significant hit following Archegos Capitals margin call, with the stock of both banks falling double-digits. A margin call happens when a leveraged account drops below an agreed level. The broker will then require the client to add funds to the account. If it can't, the broker will dump the client's shares and liquidate its holdings to make up the shortfall.

Despite the recent choppiness in the market, there are signs the economy is improving. In 2021, cyclical, energy, financial, and reopening stocks - the under-performers of 2020 - have strongly outperformed tech and high growth stocks, underscoring the sector rotation taking place. Moreover, last weeks unemployment report was a pandemic-low, a sign the labor market is improving as the economy gradually reopens and the vaccine continues to be distributed. 

The United States is set to distribute 3 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine each day. California and New York, two of the hardest-hit states, plan to open vaccinations to all residents 16 and older in the next two weeks. On December 8, before he took office, President Biden promised that his team would help administer 100 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine within his first 100 days in office. The administration has reached that goal, and now set a new goal of 200 million shots administered [in his first 100 days](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/25/president-joe-biden-holds-first-press-conference/6984142002/). Before Biden's inauguration on Jan. 20, roughly 20 million doses had been administered (the Pfizer vaccine was approved on December 11, 2021). 

In other news, the Ever Given, the massive container-ship blocking the Suez Canal, a critical artery in global trade, was finally dislodged. The week-long blockade cost roughly $9 billion a day in lost revenue.

**Highlights** 

* The March jobs report is set to be released Friday. The data are[ expected to show the economy created a whopping 630,00 jobs](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/march-jobs-report-consumer-confidence-what-to-know-in-the-week-ahead-160859015.html)  the most since October 2019 and the best the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, January 11, 2022**

After one of the wildest days Ive experienced in the market, stocks carried on yesterdays momentum, with all three major indexes advancing as market participants digested new testimony from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. 

**Markets Today**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +0.91%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): +1.52%
* Dow Jones (DIA): +0.50%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +1.05%
* Volatility Index (VIX): -5.05%
* Advanced Micro Devices (AMD): +4.02%
* Sea Limited (SE): +6.01%
* Albertsons (ACI): -9.56%
* Virgin Orbit (VORB): +27.83%
* Shake Shack (SHAK): +12.14%
* Amazon (AMZN): +2.40%

During his confirmation hearing before Congress, Powell said the US economy was healthy enough to support a reduction in the accommodative monetary policy that has propped up the markets for the last two years. This means putting an end to quantitative easing and raising the interest rate.

He said, As we move through this year & if things develop as expected, well be normalizing policy, meaning were going to end our asset purchases in March, meaning well be raising rates over the course of the year. At some point perhaps later this year we will start to allow the balance sheet to run off, and thats just the road to normalizing policy.

Powell reiterated that the Central Bank was prepared to act if the pace of inflation does not begin to moderate in the coming months. He said, If we see inflation persisting at high levels, longer than expected, if we have to raise interest rates more over time, then we will.

Powell said the moves are in response to an economy with a strong labor market, with an unemployment rate of 3.9% in December, but elevated inflation. Powell said, What that \[the unemployment rate coupled with elevated inflation\] is really telling us is that the economy no longer needs or wants the very highly accommodative policies that weve had in place to deal with the pandemic and its aftermath. Were really just going to be moving over the course of this year to a policy that is closer to normal. But its a long road to normal from where we are.

The Feds most potent tool remains interest rates, which the central bank has pinned to zero since the depths of the pandemic. Raising interest rates could address higher demand by making it more expensive to borrow. However, higher borrowing costs would not do much to address supply-side constraints and shipping bottlenecks that are greatly contributing to the rise in prices. Powell said, We can affect the demand side, we cant affect the supply side. But this really is a combination of the two.

Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield, which reached a yearly higher at 1.8% yesterday, came down after Powells speech, hovering at 1.741% at the time of writing. 

Steven Wieting, Global Chief Investment Strategist at Citigroup, said Were seeing across the board a re-rating of what the Federal Reserve will do. The likelihood is very clear that the Fed will succeed in sinking inflation. That is going to happen one way or the other and we are just trying to gather how actively the Fed will be doing that.

Regarding interest rate hikes, JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon said he sees the Fed passing four rate hikes next year, one more than the currently telegraphed three. Speaking to CNBC, Dimon said, ""It's possible that inflation is worse than people think. I, personally, would be surprised if it's just four increases this year. Four would be very easy for the economy to absorb.""

Looking ahead, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release Decembers Consumer Price Index Friday, which is currently expected to show a 7.0% jump in year-over-year prices, the largest jump since 1982. This could also spark more volatility. 

Moreover, at the end of the week, big financial institutions, including JP Morgan (JPM), Blackrock (BLK), Citigroup, and Wells Fargo (WFC) will earnings Friday morning before the opening bell.

**Highlights**

* Intel (INTC) analysts gave a nod of approval to the chipmaker on its move to recruit Microns (MU) David Zinsner to serve as Chief Financial Officer as part of a broader shakeup by CEO Pat Gelsinger. ""Intel now has a 'dream team,' with 'one of the best CEOs and one of the best CFOs in the semiconductor industry,'"" Citi analysts said. Zinsner ""has driven higher operating margins at every public company he has been CFO at.""
* The National Federation of Independent Business reported that its Small Business Optimism Index rose 0.5 point to 98.9 last month. Of small business owners who responded to the organizations survey, 22% said inflation was their primary operating concern  up from 18% in November.
* Tesla Inc sold 70,847 China-made vehicles in December, the highest monthly rate since it started manufacturing in Shanghai in 2019, data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) showed on Tuesday.
* The U.S. judge hearing the Federal Trade Commission's antitrust case against Facebook said on Tuesday that he would not dismiss the government's lawsuit.
* Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank, is reducing overdraft fees from $35 to $10 starting in May and will stop charging overdraft fees in February.
* Twitter (TWTR) has become a minority stakeholder in digital advertising company Aleph. CEO of Aleph said, We are honored to have Twitter as an investor in Aleph.

* Back Market, the French marketplace dedicated to refurbished smartphones and electronic devices, said on Tuesday it had closed an investment round of $510 million, bringing its total valuation to $5.7 billion.
* Nvidia is launching a new 12GB model of its RTX 3080 today. Revealed initially in Nvidias latest GeForce drivers, the new 12GB model goes on sale today from select board partners and offers 2GB more memory than the original 10GB RTX 3080.
* NVIDIA and Arm submitted a 28-page written submission to the UKs Competition and Markets Authority outlining why the $40 billion acquisition should be approved. In it, both companies accuse critics of romanticizing Arms history, ignoring the companys current financial condition, and overstating Arms market power. Arms energy-efficient chip designs are used in 95% of the worlds smartphones and 95% of the chips designed in China.

"180","2021-03-15",1615841103,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, March 15, 2021. Please enjoy!","Stocks rallied on Monday after a choppy day, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) closing at new record levels. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) also recovered some lost ground as market participants continue to balance optimism regarding economic growth against rising Treasury yields.

Last week, after months of negotiations, the $1.9 trillion stimulus package was signed into law by President Biden this week. The bill, called the American Rescue Plan (ARP), includes provisions like $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans, $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits through early September, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government aid. The passage of the bill came exactly one year after the World Health Organization's formal designation of the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.

Washingtons aggressive spending spree during the pandemic, combined with an increased pace of vaccinations, accommodative monetary policy, and the impending reopening of the economy have pushed estimates for growth higher while also fueling inflationary fears. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed more than 10 basis points to hover near one-year highs at 1.607%. This marks a rise of around 50 basis points compared to levels from a month ago. Yields are rising in response to inflationary fears and expectations for explosive growth as the economy reopens.  Kit Juckes, Societe Generale macro strategist, wrote in a note to clients, The pattern seems clear enough: The equity market is seeing a sector rotation but not a correction; the bond market is seeking a new equilibrium in the light of a vastly improved economic outlook in both the U.S. and elsewhere. 

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital in order to fuel their growth and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. 

Several countries have suspended distribution of AstraZenecas coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots, with Ireland being the latest. A WHO spokeswoman, Margaret Harris, said at a briefing that an advisory committee was investigating reports of individuals falling ill or dying after developing blood clots in the post-vaccination period, but that no causal link had been established. Germany, France, Italy and Spain became the latest countries Monday to suspend use of the vaccine. This is a sharp blow against the European Unions vaccination effort, which were already behind schedule.

In other news, Novavax (NVAX) recently announced [drugmaker's COVID-19 vaccine trial in the UK showed the inoculation was 96.4% effective ](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-confirms-high-levels-efficacy-against-original-and-0)against the original strain of the coronavirus.

***Hey Psychos!! Today's recap is a bit longer than usual because there was a lot of really important information released. I urge you to read until the end, especially the part regarding the CPI.***

Stocks finished mostly even, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) leading the day as market participants digested the start of earnings season, the consumer and producer price indexes, which showed an acceleration in inflation, and the Federal Reserves September meeting minutes, which are basically notes of what was discussed in the meeting. 

While supply-side disruptions have been going on since the beginning of the pandemic (when the world was essentially forced to shut down overnight), recent developments reflect the extent of these disruptions heading into the holidays, by far the busiest season for retailers. Due to congestions in the ports and sky-high shipping rates, companies like Target (TGT), Costco (COST), and Walmart (WMT) have resorted to chartering their own ships and diverting the usual routes to less congested ports. In a statement, Target recently said As co-managers of the ship, we can avoid delays from additional stops and steer clear of particularly backed-up ports.

In addition, President Biden met with leaders from the Port of Los Angeles, the Port of Long Beach, and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union to discuss supply chain issues at the ports. In the end, the parties agreed to expand port operations activities to be 24/7 nationwide. 

The latest batch of economic data due Wednesday confirmed that these supply and demand mismatches translated to ongoing inflationary pressures.  Labor Department's Consumer Price Index, core prices, excluding food and energy, rose by 4.0% in September over last year, coming down only slightly from June's 30-year high of 4.5%. And a broader measure of consumer prices including all categories rose 5.4% in September compared to last year, coming in at the fastest pace since 2008. Please, before you ask why food and energy are excluded from core CPI, read the exact reason by the Federal Reserve below. 

To understand why the categories of food and energy are more sensitive to price changes and thus not useful measures when considering broad inflationary measures, consider environmental factors that can ravage a years crops or fluctuations in the oil supply resulting from the OPEC cartel. Each is an example of a supply shock that may affect the prices for that product. However, although the prices of those goods may frequently increase or decrease at rapid rates, the price disturbances may not be related to a trend change in the economys overall price level. Instead, changes in food and energy prices often are more likely related to temporary factors that may reverse themselves later. Basically, including food and energy prices economists may be fooled into believing that general prices are rising or falling more rapidly than they really are

Please, I urge you to read the Feds exact reasoning as to why Core CPI is taken as the real measure of inflation, Ive seen a TON of misinformation spreading about this across social media. Core CPI has been calculated the exact same way for decades, I dont understand why it became so controversial this year. Please read to link below, it is fundamentally necessary for us market participants to understand how this works. 

[https://www.frbsf.org/education/publications/doctor-econ/2004/october/core-inflation-headline/](https://www.frbsf.org/education/publications/doctor-econ/2004/october/core-inflation-headline/)

In the latest monthly monetary policy meeting, the Fed signaled it would likely begin reducing the pace of asset-purchasing by $15 billion per month starting in November or December. As a reminder, since early on in the pandemic, the Fed implemented a program of quantitative easing at a clip of $120 billion per month. This is exactly what I said would happen last month, and it seems the market already priced this in. Like I have said multiple times before, I remain bullish until the Fed begins discussing raising the interest rate. 

Q3 earnings season kicked off with JP Morgan (JPM), the largest bank in the US, and BlackRock (BLK), the largest asset management company in the world, reporting earnings. Both smashed earnings estimates. Here are the numbers

**JP Morgan - JPM**

* Revenue of $30.44 billion v $29.8 billion expected
* Earnings per share of $3.74 v $3 expected

**BlackRock - BLK**

* Asset Under Management (AUM): $9.46 trillion v $7.81 trillion last year
* Revenue of $5.1 billion v $4.9 billion expected
* Earnings per share of $10.95 v $9.54

Wall Street analysts are looking for third-quarter earnings growth of about 27% on a year-over-year basis, [according to FactSet data. ](https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_100821.pdf)Though this would still be the third-fastest earnings growth rate since 2010, it would be a marked slowdown from the second quarter's nearly 90% pace.

Stocks were mixed today, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) underperforming, while previous laggards like financial, industrial, and energy stocks picked up the slack, driving both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) to fresh, intraday, all-time highs. While the past few weeks have been quite choppy, with concerns surrounding inflation and the coronavirus Delta variant weighing on the minds of investors, the overall market has displayed remarkable strength amid record corporate profits and expectations for economic expansion. Today, market participants were encouraged by the July Job Report, which showed a stronger-than-expected rebound in employment last month.

The Labor Departments July Jobs Report marked an unexpected upswing in employment, with the economy adding 943,000 jobs to the 845,000 expected. The unemployment rate was 5.4%, also better than the 5.7% expected. With the coronavirus Delta variant forcing some parts of the US to reinstate some pandemic-era measures, like indoor mask mandates, market participants were closely waiting for this unemployment report. Like I said yesterday, this Job Report was a bit of a wild card, with estimates fluctuating widely from 330,000 to the high 900,000s. Earlier in the week a report by ADP suggested private payrolls were much weaker than expected, with only 330,000 private payrolls added versus the 700,000 expected. On the other hand, Bloomberg economists estimated a gain of more than 900,000 jobs. Happy to see the report come in so positive, a great sign, that despite headwinds remaining, the labor market continues to recover. 

So far, 59% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) have reported Q2 earnings, with 88% of these beating analyst expectations, according to FactSet. This quarter is shaping up to be another record-breaking one, with corporate earnings growth rate expected to accelerate 85% year-on-year, which would be the biggest jump since the Q4 2009. 

However, it is important to note that, despite beating earnings expectations, a number of these companies have pulled back, with tepid outlooks moving forward overshadowing strong results. Moving forward, given that most companies have so far exceeded pre-pandemic levels and the current quarter has an easy comparison to last year, expectations for growth are inevitably going to moderate. This said, I think the pullback in some stocks following earnings is an overreaction. 

**Highlights**

* The Weekly Unemployment Report came in roughly in-line with analyst expectations
   * First time jobless claims: 385,000 vs 383,000 expected
   * Continuing Claims 2.93 million vs 3 million
* Walmart (WMT) is offering special bonuses to many warehouse employees to work every hour they are scheduled and, in some cases giving temporary pay raises, as the country's biggest retailer ramps up for the holiday shopping season
* Target (TGT) said it plans to invest $200 million in education programs that would cover the cost of tuition, fees and textbooks for part- and full-time workers who pursue a qualifying undergraduate degree at more than 40 institutions. It will also fund advanced degrees, paying up to $10,000 each year for masters programs at those schools. Just the latest examples of companies actively changing to become more attractive for employees. Chipotle (CMG) and Starbucks (SBUX) have similar program to this in place. 
* The crackdown in China continues& Alibaba (BABA) told investors during a call that their tax rate will balloon to 20% by the end of Q3, according to a report by Bloomberg. This is likely due to the fact that the CCP has removed a 10% preferential tax break given to key software enterprises. This is likely to affect other Chinese technology and internet stocks. 
* In other news, food-delivery giant Meituan received a $1 billion fine from the CCP for forcing merchants to work exclusively on its platform. The market cap of this company has reportedly halved since February peak of $168 billion. 
* President Biden on Thursday signed an executive order setting a target for electric vehicles, hydrogen-fuel cell and plug-in hybrid vehicles to make up 50% of U.S. sales by 2030 -- a voluntary goal that auto makers said necessitated federal support for vehicle charging stations and consumer tax incentives.

Not trying to start a debate, I'm not long or short $NVDA, don't own any, and I don't plan to open a position anytime soon, I'm just your monthly buyer of $VOO and $QQQ.  

However, to the bulls out there, what is the reason for such a MASSIVE premium for this stock?  I understand they crushed earnings and increased foecast to a nearly 50% gain in revenue by Q1 2024, but even with that premium, they are trading at a nearly 200 P/E.  

Assuming NVDA maintains that 50% premium and holds it for all 4-quarters in 2024, thats $44B in revenue which if they had 100% margins and zero cost of any kind, it would take you almost 22 years to payback the value of the stock. 

Sure, someone will tell me P/Es don't matter, and they are growing like crazy, but at what point is the value of the stock (again, almost $1 TRILLION) still out of control? 

\- Their Gross Profit is 56% which is impressive, but not unherd of (MSFT is 68%, META is 80%)   
\- Their net income is 16% which is right in line with everyones favoriate not a car company TESLA at 15%

Lets throw out fundamentals since they clearly don't matter that much for this stock and look at their growth:  $7.19B (lower than Q1 2022 of $8.29B).  

Their Q4 22 Revenue was $6.05B vs. Q4 21 of $7.64B

So grow is slower/stagnant from the previsous years, so why does that get such a massive premium?  Did they beat earnings estimates, yes, but those were concervitive.  Did they raise guidance by 50% due to the AI boom, yeah, how long will that last?  Same length as the gaming/crypto/at home boom?  Okay, then what, revenue falls again?

Stocks jumped higher in the first session of October before losing strength throughout the session, buoyed by hope that lawmakers will provide more stimulus before the November election and slightly better than expected unemployment numbers. 

The three major indices closed out the month of September red, falling an average of 4% for the first monthly loss since March. The major benchmarks posted their worst September performance since 2011, according to Yahoo Finance. But zooming out to include trading from July and August, equities third-quarter performance held up much more strongly. The S&amp;P 500 posted its best third-quarter advance since 2010 with a rise of 8.5%, per Bloomberg.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) ended the day 1.59% up, the S&amp;P (SPY) finished 0.62% up, and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.22% in another volatile session.

It seems traders are expecting Septembers volatility to carry into October, with political uncertainty surrounding the presidential election at the top of their mind, especially after the, shall we say, contentious debate. Hopes for additional, much-needed stimulus dimmed after in-person talks between Pelosi, Mnuchin, and Congressional lawmakers did not produce an agreement. While the pair said they made progress and had further discussions planned, many are skeptical any kind of deal will be reached before the election in November.

For the many, the economic situation at the hands of the pandemic remains dire, with a slew of job cuts being announced. Airlines American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) are moving forward with a collective 32,000 job cuts after contingencies tied to federal coronavirus relief aid they received earlier this year expired on Wednesday. Disney (DIS) said it would be cutting 28,000 workers across its resort business. Insurance giant Allstate (ALL) announced an 8% reduction in its workforce, impacting some 3,800 jobs. Goldman Sachs (GS) is also reportedly looking to cut about 400 jobs, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, and the oil major Shell (RDS) announced plans to cut up to 9,000 jobs.

The labor report released this week will not capture these planned layoffs, those will most likely be reflected in next weeks report. The Labor Department reported that another 837,000 people filed for first-time unemployment insurance. While this is below the 850,000 estimate and an improvement on last week's number, it is clear that the labor market is still struggling during the pandemic and needs Congressional assistance to get back on track.  Tomorrow Septembers monthly jobs report will be released. Analysts expect a fifth straight month of payroll gains and 868,000 jobs to have come back. However, after the announcement of massive job cuts this week, well have to see if analysts revise their estimates.

**Highlights**

* US manufacturing activity unexpectedly decelerated in September, according to the Institute for Supply Managements (ISM) monthly manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI). The index ticked down to 55.4 in September from 56.0 in August, whereas consensus economists expected a rise to 56.5.

"186","2021-12-12",1639271599,"Power of Compounding","Few weeks back, I wrote a post on some word of advice for young investors. There was one more thing that I forgot to emphasize in that post - The power of compounding.

Young investors, you have an opportunity of a lifetime, literally a retirement lottery ticket if you are in your early twenties and start investing a regular amount every single month. I will take a very realistic example of how much you can make by investing early. And, the best part is you don't even have to be good at analyzing companies and pick Individual stocks.

Let us say you start with a sum of $2400 at the age of 20 to start Investing in broad market based ETF like QQQ or SPY. And you put just $200 every month ($2400 a year) till you reach retirement. You would be looking at a sum of $2 million dollars at the age of 65 considering average market return of 10% per year.

Wanna hear even a more crazier story. Let's assume you are lucky to end up in a high paying job in Tech or Finance early in your career that pays 80-90K or above and you are able to save and invest $12,000 a year  ($1000 a month) in the same scenario. Starting with $12,000 at the age of 20, and adding $12,000 every year to your Investment account, you will end up with a whopping $10 million dollars at the age of 65.

Compounding is absolutely an amazing thing that is often overlooked when you start investing. Investing regularly almost like a second habit will ensure that you will have always have enough money for major life events. Increasing your monthly investment amount regularly as you grow and progress in your career will lead to even larger amounts than mentioned in above scenarios.","stocks",277,"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/redjml/power_of_compounding/"
"187","2019-03-17",1552815428,"I'm an astrophysicist and I perform my own (simple) stock analyses based on kinematic principles: comments welcome! (March 17, 2019)","Third post of the series! Thanks for everyones wonderful feedback so far and to the r/stocks moderators for their excellent support! This post reflects Friday's moves, and I am posting today (Sunday) in preparation for the upcoming trading week.

&amp;#x200B;

Quick Explanation: this approach is based on kinematic principles, which is the branch of physics and mathematics describing the motions of objects without necessarily understanding the underlying forces at play.  My script runs a loop from 50 (previously 200) to 10 days, and for each period computes the SMA and its first three derivatives, which I then combine via a weighted average with the weights set by the inverse of each SMA period. The first derivative is analogous to the stock's ""velocity"" (in %/day), the 2nd derivative is its ""acceleration"" (%/day\^2), and the third derivative is the jerk, or change in acceleration (%/day\^3). Using these three parameters, I extrapolate the price of each stock on my watchlist 10 days into the future in order to inform my own trading strategy.

&amp;#x200B;

This approach is highly simplistic: it involves no tracking of news feeds, expectations of financials, etc. (in other words, the forces behind the movements). It is simply based on the motions of each stock. I'd be interested to hear if anyone has tried a similar strategy, or has any comments/questions. If you'd like your favorite stock added, just let me know.

Thanks to all of your feedback yesterday, I've made a few improvements since my last post:

&amp;#x200B;

1. I cleaned up my source code for public consumption, which can be found on github: [https://github.com/stockscientist/sma\_optimize\_stocks](https://github.com/stockscientist/sma_optimize_stocks)
2. Most importantly, backtesting! This has been a frequently asked question, and is without doubt an important undertaking. While more rigorous backtesting is always warranted, heres what I have done so far: Taking SPY, DIA, and NDAQ as test cases, I ran a loop over the script (included as backtest.pro on github) and tested the predictions against the actual data. I examined mainly the directional accuracy (whether the price goes up or down), and used these to tune several of the parameters: namely how many derivatives to include in the projections, which max/min SMA periods to include, and how to optimally weight the outputs from different SMAs.Going back 1000 days and predicting 10 days into the future, this script was \*on average\* 61% correct at predicting the direction of change for SPY, DIA, and NDAQ. I think this is pretty decent, though of course far from perfect. Other sets of parameters that I tested typically yielded between 50-55% accuracy. For comparison, see [this](https://hackernoon.com/i-spent-20-minutes-trying-to-predict-the-stock-market-with-ai-these-are-my-results-59d48c7a388a) machine learning approach that generated excitement from the financial crowd with 54% accuracy.
3. I am now including a relative strength index (RSI) column in the table to help identify when a stock is overbought/oversold. A typical strategy is to consider RSI&gt;70 to be overbought, and RSI&lt;30 to be oversold. I try to maintain a portfolio of stocks between those values, although its possible for an RSI to remain over 70 (or below 30) for a significant period of time. Take any predictions for stocks with RSI&gt;70 with extreme caution as they are likely to experience a reversal!
4. Based on the results of the backtesting, I have changed the maximum SMA from 200 to 50, and have included the third derivative in the price projections.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I recently found this paper on a similar topic in case anyone else is interested: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895\_Kinematics\_of\_stock\_prices](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/46461895_Kinematics_of_stock_prices)

Cheers!

Disclosure: First and foremost, I attempt to make no claim whatsoever for how well these predictions will hold. They are simple extrapolations of existing trends, and will certainly change in the future. Second, I likely own positions in several of the highest ranked tickers on this list.

"189","2023-06-06",1686085086,"We are just 8 SP500 points from official new Bull Market, Sentiment Indicators indicate we will go 10% higher.","According to Barron's, The S&amp;P 500 was nearing bull market territory Friday as stocks rallied following the latest employment report.

The market benchmark was up 1.4% to 4,280.49. It would need to close at or above 4,292.438 to enter a new bull market, defined as a 20% gain from its low, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Well 2 days in a row it went thru 4292, but closed under it.   Michael James McDonald on Seeking   has recent article, where based on sentiment things he thinks should go higher.  His charts have quite the track record.   We had 4 extreme bearish short-term buy signals in last year and have never been past midway to a sell signal, so he thinks we go back to prior highs, which are about 10% higher before going down.   All we need is +.25% for an official bull market.  I tend to agree.  BTW,  IWM way stronger today than SPY and QQQ.  Makes some sense, the weakest part of the market in last year.

On his longer-term chart, a double signal, and in 2009 we only one signal, 2022 was quite a bit more bearish sentiment wise than 2009.  Never in the Great Recession did things get as negative perception wise than as in the last year. All this lines up with my observations even though we use different methods.

I have written two articles here on /stocks in last 10 days that revolved around my many years of watching the market and having never seen so many people think a recession was a sure thing before, which is not how recessions have started before.

Stocks traded higher today as market participants closely monitor developments in a new virus-relief package amid mixed signals from top officials as to the size and scope of a proposal they might support.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) led the day, finishing the day 1.53% up. The S&amp;P (SPY) finished 0.86% up and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.54% up.

Traders continue to closely monitor developments out of Washington weighing whether more stimulus will be passed, be it comprehensive or targeted. Despite Pres. Trumps recent tweet saying he was not willing to negotiate further stimulus until the election, negotiations appear to continue. According to top officials and economic analysts, the passage of additional is key in encouraging and fast-tracking the recovery of the pandemic-stricken economy. 

According to multiple reports from CNBC, the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and others, the White House is prepared to offer a new stimulus proposal totalling $1.8 trillion, about $400 billion below what the Democrats are asking for but an increase from the original $1.6 trillion offer. It's unclear what specific provisions will be included in the drafted legislation, but the earlier plan included a fresh round of $1,200 stimulus checks; expanded unemployment benefits at $400 per week and additional funding for state and local government. While a large gap still remains between the two proposals, lets hope that the White House showing willingness to negotiate adds goodwill and Congress can come to an agreement. Today Trump tweeted Covid Relief Negotiations are moving along. Go Big!

Adding to the optimis, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow told Fox Business that the President wants to do a deal. This is a remarkable turnaround considering Pres. Trumps recent tweet where he said he was not willing to negotiate an additional deal. The market has positively responded to this development.

Yesterday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin discussed further stimulus for about an hour. After the meeting Drew Hamill, Pelosis spokesperson, said in a tweet that Mnuching made clear the Presidents interest in reaching an agreement for a comprehensive package after Pelosi made clear he would not support a standalone, targeted bill. In a note to clients Jeffrey Buchbinder, LPL Financial Equity Strategist said, A compromise on a big stimulus package in Washington could potentially deliver another October surprise, but the odds are against it as Election Day approaches.

The neckline was broken last Friday and if we get a downside equal to the upside from the neckline then SPY should hit a minimum low of 392 (and 293 for QQQ.)

Even if you didn't believe this was a bear market rally or in technical analysis, a head and shoulders pattern with a neckline break is a rarity, lots of people spot and bet on potentials but here we have the real thing, even if on a short time frame.

Personally, I always thought this was a bear market rally taken to extreme levels of hopium and I'm not sure the bottom is in.  But at least with the h&amp;s I'm pretty confident we have some more short term downside in the next few days.  And then of course after Labor Day we may get our annual September pull back on top of all this.","stocks",220,"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/x0zvpz/head_and_shoulders_spy_and_qqq/"

Stocks sank today, as technology stocks plummeted, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) having its worst day since March as investors nervously eye a swift rise in the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, a disappointing consumer confidence report, and power shortages in China that threaten the global supply chain as the busy Christmas season approaches, along with the evolving Evergrande situation. 

Market participants continue to diest development coming out of Washington.  Congress members continue to race in order to pass legislation to fund the government until next year and prevent the government from defaulting and shutting down. This comes amid a backdrop of ongoing debates surrounding the bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure deal. Last night, Republicans refused to pass a bill to avert a government shutdown and raise or suspend the debt limit to prevent the US from defaulting on its debts. Unfortunately, something that is fairly routine (the debt ceiling has been raised 80 times since 1960 and three times under President Trump, with the latest suspension in 2019) has become a headline with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stating that he would not provide the Republican votes necessary.

The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield rose to 1.54% at the time of writing, the highest level since June. Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks, like technology, the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunities to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. While higher yields are generally seen as a bet on a strengthening economic environment, it does make it more expensive to borrow capital, which weighs heavily on growth stocks, which are valued heavily based on future earnings projections.

Chris Beauchamp, Chief Market Analyst at IG Group, said the prospect of higher energy prices, fueling inflation, and rises in bond yields appear to be pre-empting tighter monetary policy by central banks, have prompted widespread selling across global stock markets. Like yesterday, it is the highly-valued growth stocks that have taken the brunt of the selling, as investors fret that a lower growth, tighter policy environment will hurt these previous star performers. 

According to a report by the Conference Board, a non-profit business research organization, US consumer confidence fell to a seven-month low amid the surge in coronavirus Delta variant cases (which are finally starting to fall again), supply chain issues, and a slowdown in growth rates moving forward. The Conference Board said its consumer confidence index dropped to a reading of 109.3 this month from 115.2 in August, the third straight monthly decline. Lynne Franco, Senior Director of Economic Indicators at the Conference Board said, These back-to-back declines suggest consumers have grown more cautious and are likely to curtail spending going forward.

In other news,  a series of power cuts and even blackouts across eastern China, where most of the population lives as demand threatens to outstrip the countrys electrical supply, adding a new threat to the already slowing economy and likely further snarling already disrupted global supply chains ahead of the busy Christmas season. This can already be seen in the sky-high charter rates for container ships, which have risen 10 out of the last 13 days and have more than quadrupled since the beginning of the pandemic.

There are several reasons why electricity is in short supply. As more regions in the world reopen from pandemic-induced lockdowns, demand has skyrocketed, forcing already electricity-hungry companies to use more power. Export demand for aluminum, steel, and concrete, three of the most energy-intensive products, has been very strong domestically and abroad. Moreover, as electricity demand rises, it has pushed the price of coal, which is the main way China generates electricity, higher. 

**Highlights**

* U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said Tuesday the Chinese government is blocking its domestic airlines from buying ""tens of billions of dollars"" in airplanes. Raimondo said in remarks after a speech in Washington that China is not abiding by commitments to buy U.S. goods it made in 2020 as part of a trade deal. ""I don't know if Boeing is here... There are tens of billions of dollars of planes that Chinese airlines want to buy but the Chinese government is standing in the way.""
* Disney (DIS) and Amazon (AMZN) announced they were partnering together to launch an Alexa-powered voice assistant called Hey Disney which will be available at home Echos as well as the ones located in Disney resorts and hotels
* Netflix (NFLX) released five new mobile gaming titles to subscribers in select European markets, as the company attempts to diversify revenue sources. The company has introduced ""Stranger Things: 1984"", ""Stranger Things 3: The Game"", ""Card Blast"", ""Teeter Up"", and ""Shooting Hoops"" titles on Android to Netflix members in Spain and Italy.
* Following a ruling by the CCP, Alibaba (BABA) and other internet companies can no longer omit competitors products from their own platforms in an effort to increase competition. As a result, Alibaba has now added rival Tencent (TCEHY) WeChat payment system in some of its platforms. 
* According to a joint report by consulting firms JD Power and LMC Automotive, new vehicle sales in the US are expected to fall a staggering 25% compared to last year, just the latest example of the effect the global shortage in semiconductors is having in the automotive industry. New-vehicle retail sales in the United States are seen dropping to 888,900 units in September, from 1,182,788 a year ago.
* Ford Motor Co and its Korean battery partner SK Innovation will invest $11.4 billion to build an electric F-150 assembly plant and three battery plants in the United States, accelerating the U.S. automaker's push into electric vehicles.

"194","2021-11-28",1638130235,"Mythbusting TQQQ","It seems many posters are circulating a lot of misinformation about TQQQ (and leveraged ETFs in general) so I'm certain a lot of readers have internalized many false myths that I want to bust:

**TQQQ will always decay over time vs 3x QQQ**

FALSE

Basically TQQQ rebalances daily after the close.  The purpose of the rebalancing is to ensure TQQQ will perform at 3x the next day so it will reduce or increase it's exposure appropriately.  This rebalancing means TQQQ will have a variance to 3x QQQ over time.  If bullish, TQQQ will be &gt;3x, bearish &lt;3x which are both positive developments for investors.  The problem is choppy markets will cause TQQQ to decline in value vs. QQQ which is what a lot of myths focus on.

Bloggers have coined this ""volatility decay"" and this is a bad misnomer.  Decay implies the rebalancing is always bad as in negative to the returns on TQQQ.  For example:

On February 19, 2020 the pre-pandemic closing high for QQQ is $236.98, for TQQQ is $118.06 (pre-2021 split).  On March 23, 2020, QQQ closed at $170.46, a drop of 28.1%.  A 3x drop would be 84.2% and many bloggers would have you believe the drop would be even worse with volatility decay --  WRONG.  On March 23, 2020, TQQQ closed at $35.62, a drop of 69.8% which while significant is still way less than 3x and a *positive* variance of 14.4%

Now, let's take it from there to the close on September 1, 2020.  QQQ is at $299.92, a 75.9% gain.  3x would be 227.8% but TQQQ closed at $169.74 a 376.5% increase and a huge *positive* variance of 148.7% to 3x QQQ.  Thus, the rebalancing or ""volatility decay"" can be positive or negative.

**TQQQ will go to zero one day**

FALSE

The only way to have TQQQ drop to zero is if the NASDAQ 100 drops 33.4%+ in *one* trading session.  Remember, it has to be *one* trading session.  Just think about that, what would it take for the index to drop that much in a single day?  Probably something that makes money worthless like a nuclear war or huge asteroid strike.  And then we have circuit breakers on the exchanges.  Not going into detail but a drop of 20% should shut down trading for the day and TQQQ will rebalance.  Even if this kept on and on the bottom line is TQQQ will continue to exist.  Want more evidence?  SQQQ is still alive and kicking despite the massive bull market and many reverse stock splits.

Also bloggers have cited many leveraged ECN's and commodity ETFs closing and citing contango as a built in negative factor.  There are so many problems with this.  TQQQ is based off stock index and while contango is a real thing it is inapplicable to TQQQ.

**My Opinion**

For me TQQQ has been great for swing trading and writing options on.  But I watch it daily, use technical analysis, and have been lucky to sniff out major drops before the bottom and sell, and then get back in.  Yes, I got murdered on the way down but I recovered it all and then some.  Buy and hold (and the implied *forget*) is IMHO too dangerous no matter what backtesting tells you.

That is the big question; will you have the discipline to sell out when the next big correction hits?  And also will you buy back in before it completely bounces back?  If you don't think you can do both then I would stay away from TQQQ.

EDIT:  FYI, there have been many posts in this subreddit demonstrating the volatility decay with math.  While volatility decay is real under certain circumstances what those posts fail to explain is in bull (or bear) rallies the positive rebalancing variance will more than wipe out the decay.

Quick example, August 3, 2021 QQQ is $366.81 and TQQQ $135.01, on October 14 after much choppiness QQQ is back to $366.63 but TQQQ is only at $133.24.  That's just a -1.2% decay.  Now fast forward to November 19, 2021 and we have QQQ at $403.99 and TQQQ at 177.14, all decay has been wiped out as TQQQ now has a positive variance of 0.8% to 3x QQQ.

EDIT 2:  I would just state that I would not advocate a *buy hold and forget* TQQQ strategy.  Please be prepared to exit when warranted.","stocks",130,"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r4d4wt/mythbusting_tqqq/"

Stocks traded mixed on Thursday, with Nasdaq (QQQ) massively outperforming on the day, driving by strength in mega-caps like Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Amazon (AMZN) while the Dow Jones (DIA) fell for the second straight day. Market participants continue to digest the tail-end of a better-than-expected corporate earnings season amid a backdrop of rising inflation. 

Key Numbers For Today 

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +0.34%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): +1.04% 
* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.13%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.41%
* Apple (AAPL): +2.9%
* Amazon (AMZN): +4.14%
* NVIDIA (NVDA): +8.25%
* Alibaba (BABA): -11.26%
* Rivian (RIVN) and Lucid (LCID): -16.4% and -10.47%

After a monster run-up last month, the choppiness in the market can be attributed to mixed economic reports coming out recently. While US retail sales came in better-than-expected, a great sign that consumer demand  is staying robust, the recent report on inflation showed the fastest pace of growth in roughly 30 years. 

Earlier in the week, Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT), two of the largest retailers in the US, reported earnings. While the report was better than expected, executives from both companies raised concerns over rising prices, rising labor costs, and supply-chain disruptions affecting the bottom line. 

The possible staying power of inflation remains the central focus for market participants, as a potential damper to consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP and as a catalyst for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than originally expected. Despite starting to taper the pace of quantitative easing, the Fed has remained very accommodative and says an interest rate hike could take place sometime near the middle of next year. It would be really bad for markets if the timeline is accelerated. 

Adding another wrench in the plans, President Biden is expected to announce his nominee to be the Chair of the Fed. So far, the two main candidates are incumbent Jerome Powell and current Fed Governor Lael Brainard. 

The Labor Departments Weekly Unemployment Report came in slightly higher than expected but still eked out a new pandemic-era low. Here are the numbers:

* **Initial unemployment claims, week ended November 13:** 268,000 vs. 260,000 expected and an upwardly revised 269,000 during prior week 
* **Continuing claims, week ended November 5:** 2.080 million vs. 2.120 million expected and an upwardly revised 2.209 million during prior week

**Highlights**

* Shares of Alibaba (BABA) fell after the company disappointed in their latest earnings report and slashed guidance for the full year, citing slowing consumption trends in China. Here are the numbers:
   * **Revenue** $31.15 billion vs $32 billion expected
   * **EPS**: $1.74 vs $1.93 expected. 
   * **Guidance Forecast:** 20-23% growth in fiscal 2022 revenue, down from 27% growth expected
* Shares of NVIDIA (NVDA), my personal favorite stock, exploded higher after the company posted record revenues in gaming and data center sales and raised guidance moving forward. CEO Jensen Huang said, Demand for NVIDIA AI is surging, driven by hyperscale and cloud scale-out, and broadening adoption by more than 25,000 companies. NVIDIA RTX has reinvented computer graphics with ray tracing and AI, and is the ideal upgrade for the large, growing market of gamers and creators, as well as designers and professionals building home workstations."" Here are the numbers:
   * **Revenue:** $7.1 billion versus $6.81 billion expected.
   * **Earnings per share:** $1.17 versus $1.11 expected.
   * **Gaming revenue:** $3.22 billion versus $3.18 billion expected.
   * **Data Center revenue:** $2.94 billion versus $2.69 billion expected.
   * **Forecast for Q4:** Revenue and EPS expected to grow 50% year-over-year, much higher than 38% growth expected
* A bipartisan coalition of State Attorney Generals said it was launching an investigation into Instagrams effects on children and Facebooks role in promoting the service to young kids.

Stocks fell on Thursday, erasing yesterdays gains as market volatility continues. Stocks fell after Bloomberg reported that President Biden would propose increasing the capital gains tax rate on wealthy individuals. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 0.91% down, the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.94% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell 1.21%.

According to a report by [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/biden-to-propose-capital-gains-tax-as-high-as-43-4-for-wealthy), President Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals earning $1 million or more per year to 39.6% to help pay for a slew of social programs and the proposed infrastructure bill. The new marginal 39.6% rate would be an increase from the current base rate of 20%, the people said on the condition of anonymity because the plan is not yet public. The proposal could reverse a long-standing provision of the tax code that taxes returns on investment lower than on labor/salary. 

Corporate earnings have so far exceeded Wall Streets even lofty expectations, as companies benefited from both a surge in consumer spending as the economy opens back up and cost-cutting measures implemented during the height of the pandemic.  However, despite the largely positive earnings, many stocks have failed to react positively to the news. It seems as more positive economic data is released in terms of consumer spending and unemployment, it takes more and more impressive results to convince investors to pile into the stock. This suggests there is froth in the markets given the sky-high valuation of some companies, in our opinion.

Jim Caron, investment management fixed income portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley (MS) said, What we have is the absence of a catalyst. Everything that weve done over the last twelve months has been to build up to this point, to get this recovery, to get a very, very strong second-quarter GDP, which we think could be upwards of 10%. But after that, things start to slow down. It doesnt mean that the data gets bad, it just means on a relative basis that the third quarter will be weaker than the second quarter and the fourth quarter may be weaker than the third quarter.

**Highlights**

* Two U.S. senators have expressed concern about what they said may be an emerging pattern of safety concerns involving Tesla Inc. vehicles in the wake of a fatal crash in Texas.
* Square (SQ) announced that it plans to make new inventory-management features available to its sellers.The company is rolling out tools that help sellers automate their inventory-management processes by using barcode scanners to take stock of inventory and receiving alerts driven by machine learning to see when an item is due to run out.
* The White House announced more than 200 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine have been distributed in the US, greatly surpassing original estimates of 100 million doses delivered in the first 100 days of Bidens presidency. On the back of this robust distribution, all states are beginning to open back up.
* Mortgage applications jumped 8.6% in the week ended April 16, marking the biggest jump since late January as mortgage rates pulled back following a surge, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA).

"197","2020-07-08",1594248995,"My 1 year TSLA ride and how I DCA out of my position.","Hi all. Today I officially closed out my Tesla position at least for the time being. For me the price has gotten to high for my personal comfort level so I sold my last 2 shares and I feel fine about it. Here is a story of my 1 year ride on the Tesla coaster. 

My first purchase was 5 shares back in June of 2019 @ a price of $220 a share. I work in the solar industry and was seeing how many power walls my company was installing to pair with solar projects. I also was noticing more and more Tesla's on the road and this is what swayed my decision to jump into what at the time was considered a bad stock. By July the stock was up to $260 and I was feeling great about my investment. Earning were just around the corner so I decided to hold and see what happens. It did not go well. The stock dropped right back to my purchase price and even dipped below a few times. I stuck with it because I believed in the company and my position never got to -10% which is a rule I try to follow and cut loses there. Thank good I stuck with it because we all know what happened from there. October earnings hit and the price jumped and continued to climb. 

My next purchase was 1 share @ $354 in late November. Next quarter earnings come out and that's when things really got crazy. By January I was over 100% return on my investment. This is where I made my first sale. I sold 3 shares or half my position @ $479 a share and essentially took all my risk off the table. This is a strategy I always take with any stock that has a 100% return. I've been lucky in the 10ish years I've been investing to have had that opportunity several times. It helps that I started investing in the greatest bull marker ever but I also did my research, learned from past mistakes, and tried not to repeat those mistakes. 

My next sale was 1 Share @ $731 in early February. This locked in official profit but also left me with 2 shares to wait and see if this rocket ship would continue. Covid hit and the market dived. However it was very easy for me to sit and watch as my Tesla shares went from $900 to $400 because I had already made money on the trade. Had I been smart I would have bought back in and rode the wave again but I had decided to put most of my profits into QQQ and I also wasn't sure the selling was over. 

Today after seeing the crazy run Tesla has been on I decided to end this adventure for now and sold my last 2 shares @ $1393. This put my total profit on this trade at $3,493 minus some small commissions.  

My average purchase price was approx $243 and my average sale price was $825. Sure had I've had the guts to keep all 6 shares I would have done even better but for me I feel much better reducing my exposure as a stock climbs that rapidly. 

I see lots of post on here about DCA into a stock but not many on DCA out which to me is a great strategy as well. It's incredibly hard to nail to perfect time to get into a position and it's just as hard to decide the perfect time to get out. DCA both ways for me takes away some of that FOMO especially if you have already locked in 100% gains.

Hope you enjoyed my story. Keep learning, keep investing.","stocks",53,"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/hnrk10/my_1_year_tsla_ride_and_how_i_dca_out_of_my/"
"198","2021-12-08",1638970567,"Why is NVDA so richly valued?","Hi everyone, I'd like to preface this by saying that I'm a new investor around 3-months and that I'm not dogging anyone's investment decisions. I primarily invest by DCA into ETFs like SPY, QQQ and DIA. I've also decided to branch out by nibbling on individual stocks within the QQQ. I find NVDA interesting and hold a small position from when it was $226/share, I think it has a good business model, a good history of profitability and it has an edge over other chipmakers in the sense that they're the best at graphics technology.

However, I can't understand why people continue buying into NVDA stock at current values where the PE is 95+ NVDA has the potential to grow no doubt, but does it really have the potential to grow at a rate that justifies such a rich valuation today? Or is it just that traders/WSB types are playing games with the stock?

Wouldn't a better investment be to look elsewhere in the semiconductor industry for better deals? I like MU (PE: 17) because RAM and storage is needed universally for pretty much anything that needs a chip, AMAT (PE: 26) because they make equipment for foundries which means if NVDA wins, AMAT wins. Investing in TSM (PE: 31) might be good for similar reasons as AMAT.

I acknowledge that I don't know too much about investing (obviously) and don't even know necessarily much about reading up on fundamentals. I mainly look at PE, PEG and look at the historical gains of the stock and company. I'd just like to have a better understanding.

Stocks traded mostly lower today, losing some of yesterdays gains. Market participants are digesting the first batch of corporate earnings, special events from giants Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL), and as usual, developments in Washington regarding fiscal stimulus.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished even on the day. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) 0.64% down and the Dow Jones (DIA) finished 0.58%.

Economists and financial analysts expect companies within the S&amp;P 500 to post an aggregate earnings per share decline of 19.4% over this year. This estimate is higher than the 20.5% decline predicted back in the Spring. LPL Research said in a note, The increase in analysts earnings estimates reflects increased confidence in the outlook, even with the challenges Covid-19 still presents in terms of social distancing, various safety protocols, and shifting consumer behavior. We have been encouraged by recent data pointing to a continued steady reopening of the economy, and we believe the likelihood that additional lockdowns may meaningfully impair business activity remains very low.

Today, in a letter, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the White Houses new proposal for coronavirus aid, saying that in terms of addressing testing, tracing and treatment, what the Trump Administration has offered is wholly insufficient. After a day of promising developments yesterday, it appears stimulus negotiations have stalled once again. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel said his party was preparing a new, targeted package of roughly $500 billion. However, Pelosi has stated in the past, in response to the airline relief bill, that she will not support targeted stimulus, only a comprehensive package. Over the weekend, the Trump administration called on Congress to pass a smaller $1.8 billion coronavirus relief bill as negotiations on a bigger package continue to run into roadblocks.

"201","2021-08-16",1629145259,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, August 16, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, August 16, 2021**

Stocks finished mixed, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) remarkably recovering losses early in the session to narrowly eke out a new intraday record high despite massive geopolitical concerns and disappointing economic data coming out of China. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) also recovered to finish roughly even while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, was down 0.75% at the time of writing.

China released economic data for July that showed growth rates slow down dramatically as the worlds second largest economy battles with summer flooding and the resurgence of coronavirus thanks to the highly contagious delta variant. Industrial production, a gauge of activity in the manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors, grew by 6.4% year-over-year in July, a sharp deceleration from the 8.3% rise in June and below the 7.9% growth expected. Retail sales, a key measurement of consumer sentiment in the worlds most populous nation, grew by 8.5% in July, way below the 12.1% increase in June and missing the 11.5% expected by economists.

The National Bureau of Statistics noted the impact of multiple factors including the growing external uncertainties and the domestic COVID-19 epidemic and flooding situation, according to a release. The bureau added that the economic recovery is still unstable and uneven.

In other, very, very sad news, disorder in Afghanistan further weighed on global markets, with chaos erupting in the capital city of Kabul the last few days as civilians tried to flee the country being swiftly overtaken by the Taliban. Amid the pullback of US forces after more than twenty years of being in the country, the Taliban have regained control of the country with terrifying, ruthless swiftness. As of today, the President of Afghanistan fled the country and the Taliban is in the process of forming a new government. This is devastating news and breaks my heart to see.

In more unfortunate news, the number of children hospitalized in the US with COVID-19 has reached a new record of 1902 across the country as of Saturday. According to Reuters, children now compromise 2.4% of all coronavirus hospitalizations as the surge brought on by the delta variant continues. Moreover, according to Reuters, the number of COVID-19 patients aged 18 to 29, 30 to 39 and 40 to 49 also reached record level highs last week.

The U.S. now has an average of about 129,000 new COVID-19 cases per day, a rate that has doubled in a little over two weeks, the number of hospitalized is at a six month high, and roughly 600 people are dying each day, double the death rate seen in late July.

However, while this is definitely not good, it is important to mention that cases remain highly concentrated in areas of high vaccine hesitancy. According to John Hopkins University, almost S of all COVID hospitalizations in the US are in Texas or Florida.

According to data analysis by the Associated Press using data through May 2021, shows that 98.9% of those hospitalized with COVID are unvaccinated (only 1,200 of 107,000 hospitalizations as of May 2021). Dr. Rochelle Wolensky, Director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said There is a clear message that is coming through: This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.

A fifth of the nation's COVID-19 hospitalizations are in Florida, where the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients hit a record 16,100 on Saturday, according to a Reuters tally. More than 90% of the state's intensive care beds are filled, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services.

As of Friday, 91% of companies in the SPY have reported Q2 earnings, with 87% of these topping consensus estimates on earnings per share, according to data compiled by FactSet. The expected, year-over-year overall growth rate for the SPY currently stands at 89.3%, the fastest increase since the Q4 2009. David Kostin, Chief US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, said In an earnings season with many surprises  including the highest frequency of EPS \[earnings per share\] beats in our 22-year data history  one of the most notable was the surge in corporate buyback activity. Strong corporate equity demand is one reason we forecast a 5% return to our SPY year-end target of $470

**Highlights**

* In the past month or so, financial, material, industrial, and healthcare stocks have been the outperformers in the SPY while the rally in tech stocks has cooled down.
* Shares of Tesla (TSLA) fell after regulators from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it opened a formal safety investigation into Teslas autopilot system. NHTSA says it has identified 11 crashes since January 2018 in which Tesla models ""have encountered first responder scenes and subsequently struck one or more vehicles involved with those scenes.""
* Bluesky, an organization funded by Twitter (TWTR) to build technology aimed at fundamentally changing how social media platforms operate, announced Jay Graber, a founder of a social events startup and digital currency developer, to lead the project.
* Movie Free Guy grossed $28.4 million in the US during its opening weekend, higher than the $15-17 million expected. Unlike other movies, this one was not released on stream simultaneously and is a theater exclusive for the next 6 weeks. AMC stock responded positively to this.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning January 6th, 2020.

# **Geopolitical tensions could hold back stocks in the week ahead, as investors await jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/03/geopolitical-tensions-could-hold-back-stocks-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
&gt; Geopolitical concerns could continue to weigh on stocks in the week ahead, leaving investors wondering whether Middle East tensions will be the catalyst for a much anticipated market pullback.
*****
&gt; Stocks sold off Friday, the second trading day of the year, after a rally to new highs on Thursday. The market was slammed after the U.S. killed Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, sparking a rally in oil prices and raising concerns Iran will take some retaliatory action.
*****
&gt; The big event in the coming week is the December employment report, expected to show 160,000 payrolls were added and average earnings rose 3.1% year-over-year, according to Refinitiv. The jobs report is especially important after Decembers ISM manufacturing data Friday was surprisingly negative and the weakest in more than a decade.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the four-day week at 3,235, with a loss of 0.2%, after Fridays 0.7% decline. Treasury yields retreated on Friday, as buyers moved into the safety of bonds and the 10-year yield was at 1.78%.
*****
&gt; This was a textbook rationale for a bout of profit taking, but that said, I dont think its dramatic, said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Nonetheless, the question will be when do buyers come in ... Much will depend on this weekend and next week in terms of headlines from both the White House and Iran.
*****
&gt; Some analysts have been looking for a minor selloff in stocks after the fourth quarters 8.5% gain in the S&amp;P 500. But whether Fridays decline is the start of something bigger is unclear.
*****
&gt; It could be, but only in retrospect will you know for sure, said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group.
*****
&gt; Boockvar said if Iran takes some minor action, the market could shrug it off, oil could lose its gains, and stocks could move higher again.
*****
&gt; We may see Treasurys continue to get a big bid, gold get a bid and the safe-haven currencies get a bid. If we go into things next week and all things are quiet, the market will pay attention to the data, Krosby said.
*****
&gt; Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities, expects to see Treasury yields lower initially. I think short-term, the geopolitical risk is probably going to override any fundamental views that people have of the marketplace, he said.
*****
&gt; But there could be a catalyst for some Treasury selling with the issuance of high level of corporate bonds in the coming week. Faranello expects the year to start off strong, with corporate treasurers looking to raise about $30 billion to $35 billion in the debt market.
*****
&gt; Strategists said they will be looking closely at the jobs data after Fridays surprisingly weak manufacturing survey from the Institute for Supply Management, which was expected to have been better because of the trade agreement.
*****
&gt; Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, said the survey actually took place before the trade deal was announced, and hes waiting for the results of the next couple of reports.
*****
&gt; He expects to see 165,000 jobs added in December, off of 266,000 in November, which was in part skewed by the end of GMs strike. I think theres a little upside risk. It seems like we saw a pretty strong Christmas season, he said, adding there could have been more hiring than was factored into seasonal adjustments.

# Typical January Trading: Volatile Last 20 Years

&gt; Yesterday major indexes continued their recent trend of strength on the first trading day of 2020. While today the market has turned weaker on escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran. This type of volatility was once quite rare in January. However since 2000, the S&amp;P 500 has declined ten times in twenty years in January. This recent weakness can be seen in the above January seasonal pattern chart.

&gt; Over the last 21 years, Only NASDAQ has posted a full-month average gain. DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 have started January positive, only to surrender early-month gains by the eighth trading day. Greatest weakness has appeared just after mid-month, the eleventh trading day. Mild average losses on or around the eleventh trading day quickly swell to over 2% for DJIA and nearly as much for S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000.

# A Banner Year for US Equities

&gt; 2019 was surely a banner year for US equities. With a total return of 31.5%, the S&amp;P 500's gain in 2019 was nearly three times the historical average 12-month return of 11.7%. That's strong! In the chart below we compare the S&amp;P 500's annualized returns over the last one, two, five, ten, and twenty years to its average annualized returns over those same time frames since 1928. While the one-year return sticks out like a sore thumb, we would note that the S&amp;P 500's annualized returns over the last two, three, and ten years are also above average. Almost as notable as the fact that the one year return has been so much stronger than average is that the S&amp;P 500's two-year return is less than two percentage points above its historical average. That just shows how bad 2018 was! Looking further out, the only time frame where returns are below average is over the last twenty years where the 6.1% annualized gain is almost five percentage points below the historical average. Over a full twenty years, that's a difference of tripling your investment versus making eight times your investment!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/01/010220-Annualized-returns.png))**

&gt; The chart below compares how current returns during the above time frames rank on a percentile basis relative to all other periods. The S&amp;P 500's one-year return ranks in the 85th percentile which is pretty extreme. For the two, five, and ten year periods, though, current returns are much more middle of the road. Conversely, as stretched as extreme to the upside that the one-year return is relative to all other periods, the twenty-year return is even more depressed to the downside. At just 4.6, more than 95% of all other 20-year periods have been better than the last 20.

&gt; Finally, as mentioned above the last year has certainly been a strong one, and it follows a year where returns had been abnormally poor. The chart below shows the rolling 12-month total return for the S&amp;P 500 going back to 1990. The gain of 31.49% over the last year was the strongest for the S&amp;P 500 in six years coming up just shy of the 32.39% gain in 2013. Last year at this time, though, the S&amp;P 500 was down over 4% on a total return basis in the prior 12 months.

# 2019 and 2020 Dogs of the Dow

&gt; The Dogs of the Dow strategy is a simple, hands-off investment approach that says to buy the 10 highest yielding stocks in the Dow 30 at the start of each year. With the calendar turning over from 2019 to 2020, below is a look at how the Dogs strategy performed in 2019. As shown, the 10 Dogs posted a total return of 19.38% in 2019, which was below the 25% return for the Dow and well below the 28% that the 20 non-Dogs returned. The biggest winner in the Dogs in 2019 was JP Morgan (JPM) with a gain of 47.27%, but Pfizer's (PFE) decline of 6.92% really hurt overall performance.

&gt; The 20 non-Dogs were led by Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Visa (V), and United Tech (UTX), while Walgreens Boots (WBA) and 3M (MMM) were the two non-Dogs that fell in 2019.

&gt; Moving on to 2020, below is a list of this year's Dogs of the Dow. Eight of the ten Dogs from 2019 remain on the list, while 3M (MMM) and Walgreens Boots (WBA) -- the two non-Dogs that fell in 2019 -- have replaced JP Morgan (JPM) and Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) -- the two biggest gainers of the Dogs in 2019. Dow Inc. (DOW) is the highest yielding Dog at 5.12%, followed by Exxon (XOM), IBM, and Verizon (VZ), which all have dividend yields above 4%.

# Full Year 2019, Q4, and December Asset Class Total Returns

&gt; Below are the final total return performance numbers for key ETFs across asset classes in 2019. For each ETF, we also include its performance in Q4 and December.

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 rallied 2.9% in December and 8.99% in Q4 to finish the full year up 31.22%. The Tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) was by far the best performing US index ETF in 2019 with a gain of 38.96%, and it was the third best ETF in the entire matrix. The title of best performing ETF in 2019 goes to the S&amp;P 500 Technology sector ETF (XLK), which rallied 49.86%. Remember, 40% of XLK is made up of just Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT), which gained 89% and 58% in 2019, respectively. The Russia stock market ETF (RSX) was the second biggest winner in the matrix with a 2019 total return of 40.79%.

&gt; Everywhere you look across the equity landscape, there were big winners in 2019, but the weakest area of the market was the Energy sector ETF (XLE). Even still, XLE managed to put up double-digit percentage gains on the year at +11.74%.

&gt; In the commodities space, we saw oil gain 32.61% in 2019, which actually bested the gain for the S&amp;P 500. Gold (GLD) and silver (SLV) both put in solid gains in the mid-teens, while the perpetually losing natural gas ETF (UNG) was the only ticker in the matrix that fell across all three time frames (December, Q4, and full year).

&gt; Looking at fixed income, the aggregate bond market ETFs (AGG and BND) posted total returns of 8%+, while the 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT) gained 14% on the year. Q4 and December were tough for fixed income, however, as rates moved higher.

# January Almanac: Average Performance Slips in Presidential Election Years

&gt; January has quite a reputation on Wall Street as an influx of cash from yearend bonuses and annual allocations typically propels stocks higher. January ranks #1 for NASDAQ (since 1971), but fifth on the S&amp;P 500 and sixth for DJIA since 1950. It is the end of the best three-month span and holds a full docket of indicators and seasonalities.

&gt; DJIA and S&amp;P rankings did slip from 2000 to 2016 as both indices suffered losses in ten of those seventeen Januarys with three in a row, 2008, 2009 and 2010 and then again in 2014 to 2016. January 2009 has the dubious honor of being the worst January on record for DJIA (-8.8%) and S&amp;P 500 (-8.6%) since 1901 and 1931 respectively. Last year, January was downright stellar after the worst December since 1931 for DJIA and S&amp;P 500.

&gt; In election years, Januarys have been weaker. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 slip to number #8 while DJIA average performance dips negative. NASDAQ slips to #3, but average performance remains respectable at 1.7%.

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks.","stocks",22,"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ejx7sw/wall_street_week_ahead_for_the_trading_week/"
"203","2022-03-14",1647291467,"Lost $10k in the market so far in 2022","It really sucks because I got into the market in late 2021. I purchased VOO, QQQ, Shopify and a few others. By late Jan I was done 6 or 7k. Then I ""bought the dip"" in Tesla, Upstart, Google, Nio, which caused further losses.  I even bought some crypto, but I was able to recover my loss in that by buying Bitcoin when it was at $33k and sold at $45k...the only smart thing I did...

I made a big mistake, I know. Problem is, what should I do now? I still got about $20k in the market now, around $10k in the index funds mentioned, the rest in stocks. Got about $3k in Tesla, $3k in Upstart, and the rest in Google, Disney, and McDonalds.

Good thing I'm young, and I still got over $100k in cash saved up. Late last year was when I started to invest (bad timing!) and I decided to take $30k to play around and this is what happened. 

Should I sell most of it now (given that everyone say the market will drop further), and ""accept the loss"", and do DCA on index funds from now? 

BTW, what caused the big drop today? Do you think it'll tank further on Wed when Fed raises rate? Please advise. Would like to hear from more seasoned investors.

Despite the market declining modestly the last three days, it is encouraging to see volatility decreasing this week  after the wild swings the market experienced in the last few weeks. As said before, I thought the initial sell-off after the April Consumer Price Index was released was overblown for several reasons and am encouraged by this weeks price action.  

Leadership in equity markets has see-sawed between cyclical and value stocks and technology stocks, as market participants weigh the prospects for a strong economic rebound as the US economy continues to reopen with the possibility that the pick-up in activity may generate a surge in inflation. After leading the market higher in April, in the last month, the Nasdaq is down 4.77% compared to 0.79% down in the S&amp;P 500. In my view, this dip could represent a great opportunity given earnings have been extremely strong and many companies have significantly raised guidance moving forward. 

The Federal Reserve released its April Meeting Minutes (basically a written record of what happened in the meeting), which said that participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committees maximum-employment and price-stability goals and reiterated, for like the millionth time, that they did not believe a near-term adjustment of monetary policy was needed. Much of the recent volatility in the market is due to investors afraid that a surge in inflation may cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy, so hopefully this commentary by the Fed can calm things down. [Read the entire meeting minutes here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210428.pdf)

However, it is important to note, the minutes covered the meeting before the release of the April Jobs Report, which came in much weaker than expected (which bolsters the Feds argument that employment remains far from their goal) and the Consumer Price Index, which showed a greater-than-expected increase in consumer prices. That said, the recent reports are extremely unlikely to change the Feds view given Powell and other monetary officials have said they expect any inflation to be transitory and want to see a string of strong labor reports before adjustments to the current policy are considered.

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures transitory. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses. 

Moreover, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be transitory as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a string of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, theres a very large group of people who are not. Finally, the April Job Report, which showed the economy gained only 266,000 jobs compared to the 1 million expected and marked a sharp deceleration in growth compared to March, bolsters Powells argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

**Highlights**

* After declining in recent weeks, the sell-off in cryptocurrencies across the board intensified, with Bitcoin (BTC) falling below $40,000 after the People Bank of China (PBOC) doubled down on its stance and released a statement reiterating that digital tokens shouldnt be used for transactions. The PBOC posted in their official WeChat account, Virtual currencies should not and cannot be used in the market because theyre not real currencies. Its important to note the statement doesnt have any new regulatory steps, according to Yu Lingqu, a vice director at the China Development Institute think-tank in Shenzhen. 
* Ford Motor (F) is expected to unveil an all-electric version of its bestselling F-150 pickup truck tonight
* The US dollar dipped on Tuesday for the fifth straight session, reaching its lowest level against a basket of currencies since late February on waning fears that inflation spikes could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated, another great sign that inflationary fears are overblown. 
* Nvidia (NVDA) is extending its cryptocurrency mining limits to newly manufactured GeForce RTX 3080, RTX 3070, and RTX 3060 Ti graphics cards. After nerfing the hash rates of the RTX 3060 for its launch in February, Nvidia is now starting to label new cards with a Lite Hash Rate or LHR '' identifier to let potential customers know the cards will be restricted for mining. NVDA offers a separate, specialized mining processor that has the best performance for mining but will not be able to handle graphics. 
* In a Ford factory in Michigan, President Biden promoted his $174 billion plan to promote and accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles across the United States and planned to roll-back vehicle emission standards. According to the fact sheet, Biden's plan ""proposes cost-sharing grants to support new high capacity battery facilities in the United States and backs grants to fund the retooling of shuttered factories ""to build advanced vehicles and parts.""
* Michael Burry, the investor famous for calling the 2008 housing market bubble and portrayed by Christian Bale in the movie The Big Short, recently unveiled a huge bearish bet on Tesla. Scion Asset Management, Burrys firm, said in a regulatory filing it had put options on 800,100 shares of Tesla, as of the end of Quarter 1, a value of $534 million. Details on the strike price of the puts, their value and whether they are part of a broader trade are not publicly available.
* Interestingly, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) has sold nearly all of its Wells Fargo (WFC) stock, a position the company has held since 1989. In a regulatory filing on Monday, Berkshire said it owned just $26.4 million of shares of WFC as of March 31, down from around $32 billion in January 2018.

"205","2022-05-13",1652401632,"A simple South Park index fund beats the S&amp;P (not a total meme)","# Intro

I'm aware of how WallStreetBets-y this post sounds, and to be fair I did post something similar there [earlier today](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uo246c/ask_and_you_shall_receive_the_south_park/). But bear with me - I tried to be more sober with this analysis.

I made [this Inverse Cramer Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/uiipwu/this_is_actually_beating_the_sp_by_over_30_for/), which is beating the S&amp;P by \*20% YTD - I also made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ujt0lx/i_built_the_inverse_cramer_index_what_should_i_do/) asking folks what I should do next, and the highest upvoted comment was a portfolio that invested in stocks based on South Park mentions. So I built it.

# The Question

Is a portfolio that invests in stocks when South Park mentions them a viable investment strategy?

# The Data

I originally used the South Park Fandom site to try and brute force scrape every episode script and compare to every company name in the NYSE/NASDAQ database. This picked up a lot of shit though (and it also didn't pick up a lot of stuff that it should have, like a mention of Campbell's Soup in the 2015 episode Red Man's Greed), so had to figure out a different way to get all that data. I got creative - found out that Wikipedia has a summary for every episode, and links to the company names, so I built out a script that pulled tickers by scraping for these company names.

# The Strategy

I tried a bunch of things. Because the signals we get from the show are only buy signals, we have to create the sell signals ourselves based on some sort of unbiased metric. First, I tried making a few investment windows, aka selling all buy picks after x days since the last buy mention - I tried with 30 days, 60 days, 120 days, and 360 days.

Most investment windows were on par or slightly outperformed the S&amp;P. The iteration that worked best was selling completely once the next episode mention occurs, so that you're always fully invested in the most recent episode's picks. This ends up exposing you pretty strongly to South Park as a stockpicker aka signal producer, which I guess is exactly what you want. If I were doing this in an actual portfolio like the Inverse Cramer, I'd do the investment windows, albeit maybe a larger window, greater than 365 days, just because of tax reasons.

# The Performance

[https://i.imgur.com/waNPQAp.png](https://i.imgur.com/waNPQAp.png)

South Park destroys. Not what I was expecting at all. An increase of about 1100% over 7 years (including the recent downturn), compared to close to 200% for SPY and 300% for QQQ. This bakes in about a 50% CAGR for the past 7 years, with a Sharpe of about 1.4. Keep in mind, though, that this seems to essentially be a ""buy $BBW and $VIAC during the pandemic"" strategy that causes this much outperformance - otherwise, the results would likely be only a few percentage points of outperformance, based on the South Park picks beating, but essentially tracking the other indexes.

# Discussion/Conclusion

No fucking clue lmao - I would never invest based on South Park data. Maybe that's why I'm poor though. On a more serious note, the way many hedge funds get their supposed ""edge"" is by paying a lot of money for alternative datasets like this. Some others that I've heard of are parking lot fill data, company mentions on Instagram posts weighted by follower count, and I'd definitely assume WallStreetBets sentiment analysis tracking. **Any other alternative datasets you've been curious about?**","stocks",27,"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/uofcca/a_simple_south_park_index_fund_beats_the_sp_not_a/"

"207","2021-07-13",1626209120,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, July 13, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, July 13, 2021**

Today was quite action-packed, with both the S&amp;amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) once again recording a fresh intraday high for the second time this week before turning lower towards the end of the session. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, performed the worst, falling 1.75% at the time of writing. Market participants are digesting the beginning of Q2 earning season and a new report that showed in June, consumer prices have surged by the most since 2008.

The Labor Departments June Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from Mays 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price of energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last years pandemic-era lows.

While the CPI print is not ideal, the markets somewhat muted reaction (though there was a little volatility) seems to confirm that market participants are increasingly pricing in higher-than-expected inflationary data and are buying into the Federal Reserves argument that current pressures are transitory and due to pandemic-related disruptions. Moreover, it is very important to consider that current inflationary data is calculated on a year-on-year basis, so base effects are very much inflating the current numbers. In other words, inflationary readings are high because they are being measured using numbers from June 2020 when prices across the board collapsed as lockdowns and social distancing policies were implemented across the world. As I have said many times in the past, I am personally not yet worried about current inflationary pressures translating into a prolonged cycle of higher prices, though one always has to acknowledge the risks in the market and be prepared to act. 

In other news, Q2 earnings seasons kicked off today, with two of the largest banks in the US, JP Morgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) both reporting today, as well as Pepsi (PEP). JP Morgan, which is often considered a bellwether for the US economy given its sheer size, reported great results, driven in part by the release of $3 billion the bank had set aside to protect against potential losses from default loans during the pandemic, a sign that consumers held up better than the bank expected. JPM recorded revenues of $31.4 billion and profits of $11.948 billion, a staggering improvement from profits of $4.687 billion a year ago. One downside from the earnings report is a sharp reduction in revenues produced from trading, which is not surprising given the insane run by the market in 2020. 

This quarter, earnings for companies in the SPY are expected to grow by 64% year-on-year, according to FactSet, which would mark the fastest rate of earnings growth since the fourth quarter of 2009, when the US was emerging from the 2008 housing-bubble induced recession. 

A big part of the strong Q2 earnings growth is easy comparisons to Q2 2020, a period that represented the bottom of the Covid-19 earnings impact. But Q2 2021 estimates also reflect genuine growth, with total index earnings expected to be up +8.8% compared to the pre-Covid 2019 Q2 period. In other words, even when compared to an earnings season 2 years ago, well before the coronavirus pandemic, this earnings season is expected to show very strong growth. Estimates for Q2 and beyond have been steadily going up, with the current +60.5% earnings growth rate up from +50.6% at the end of March and +41.6% at the start of January 2021.

Goldman Sachs strategist David Kosting said that market participants should focus on three questions heading into this earnings season: (1) How will companies deal with rising material costs and supply chain disruptions? (2) How are companies planning to prioritize cash spending? (3) How will companies deal with policy uncertainties, especially surrounding a potential tax hike?

In addition to earnings season, market participants are also looking forward to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell giving his semi-annual Monetary Policy Report to Congress Wednesday and Thursday of this week. Analysts are expecting Powell to once again strike a dovish tone (meaning unlikely to take aggressive action against inflation and instead favor employment), given the mixed June Job Report, which saw a better than expected number of jobs added to the economy but the unemployment rate tick higher and last weeks meeting minutes which showed an increasing divide between members regarding the timeline to begin tapering quantitative easing. In my view, Powell is trying to do three things in the upcoming meeting: (1) reiterate his view that the recovery of the economy is not yet complete, (2) inflation is a result of pandemic-era disruptions, and (3) prevent a repeat of the 2013 Taper Tantrum, a unwarranted, silly, collective market-panic that triggered a spike in U.S. Treasury yields after investors learned that the Federal Reserve was slowly putting the brakes on its quantitative easing program passed during the height of the 2008-09 recession. Moving ahead, further economic reports on consumer price inflation and retail sales out this week are expected to once again underscore that the pace of economic recovery in the US remains limited by supply chain disruptions and labor market imbalances.

This is a long post, so if you want skip to the meat of it jump to, **Feedback Loops.**

Given the recent market volatility and all the theorizing around causes/possible outcomes(omicron, fed, etc.) and discussions around stocks/indices being ""cheap""/""overvalued""/etc. I thought I'd share some info on how options activity might be the primary driver of the erratic stock price movements recently (and in the near future). As a result even if you only trade stocks, it might be worth your while to learn how options impact the game.

Options trading activity is at an all-time high as of November(in last 2 years, on some days, options volume is higher than underlying stock volume!) and this leads to very large buying/selling flows of the underlying stocks from market makers who are hedging their risk. Depending on how close we are to large options expiration dates the behavior of these flows can change drastically setting off large market movements in either direction.

Last monthly OPEX(options expiration) occurred on 11/19, next large OPEX will be on 12/17. I think 11/19 OPEX is what paved the way for the subsequent drop the following week in markets due to large shift in market maker hedges after OPEX. I also think if there's a bounce in the market for a Santa Rally it will likely be near/shortly after the next OPEX on 12/17. Below I explain in detail how market maker hedging of stock options can drive price flow in the underlying stocks. I've attempted to keep it simple enough for people of any experience level to follow.

**Basics**

**Price and Order Book**

Every trade made in the market has 2 sides to it. A buyer and a seller. ""Price"" as we see on a chart is a real-time negotiation occurring between a group of buyers and a group of sellers. The results of these negotiations are entered into a ledger called an order book. We typically visualize that order book as stock charts, tickers, etc.

The amount of real buyers/sellers that will want to negotiate at any given time determines how easy it will be for you to buy/sell a stock (a.k.a liquidity). If you don't have enough buyers/sellers at a price, then price will have to move up or down in order to entice more buyer/sellers. Less buyers/sellers or an imbalance of buyers/sellers -&gt; more price movement. 

**Futures/Options**

Futures can be thought of as a trade that's added to the order book for a future date instead of for now. 

Why do this? Buyers/sellers can lock in prices for a future date to allow for longer-term stability/planning rather than be forced to speculate on what prices might be at that date.

Options can be thought of as the option to add a trade to the order book for a future date.

**Market Makers**

Market makers are players(usually banks/financial institutions) who make money by providing liquidity (a.k.a make it easier for you to buy/sell a stock). They do this by adding artificial buyers and sellers on both sides of the order book with a slight price difference (a.k.a spread). 

Generally their goal is to make profit only from the spread, rather than speculate in the market by actually buying/selling the stock like investors/traders(a.k.a you) are. This way their profits are tied to how many people are trading, not how the market does.

E.g

Market maker adds an artificial buy and artificial sell order on the book.

Ask $101

Bid $99

Real seller comes in and sells the stock for $99 to market maker. Real buyer comes in and buys the same stock for $101 from the market maker. Market maker keeps $2 profit.

**Tail Wagging The Dog**

**Hedging Options**

As mentioned earlier the primarily goal of market makers is to be unaffected by market movements, while profiting off spread. They do this by making sure they have an equal amount of bets up and down(a.k.a hedging).

The below table shows how they initially hedge based on what bet the trader places. As the options get closer to expiration their value will decrease and the market maker will reduce their hedge as the value of the option decreases.  E.g. As a call option loses value the market maker will sell stock to reduce their hedge to match the reduced value of the call option.

&amp;#x200B;

|Trader Bet|Market Maker Bet|Market Maker Initial Hedge|Market Maker Hedge as OPEX nears|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Buy Call|Sell Call|Buy Stock|Sell Stock|
|Sell Call|Buy Call|Sell Stock|Buy Stock|
|Buy Put|Sell Put|Sell Stock|Buy Stock|
|Sell Put|Buy Put|Buy Stock|Sell Stock|

&amp;#x200B;

The end result here is a range of outcomes. We will only discuss the two extremes, but any mixture of these and transition between these is possible:

1. Market maker is hedging with the market flow in the underlying stock.

2. Market maker is hedging against the market flow in the underlying stock.

Outcome 1 can result in what's typically referred to as a ""gamma squeeze"". 

\- Traders buy a large number of call/put options. 

\- Market maker buys/sells a large amount of underlying stock causing the price to shift up/down.

\- Traders options are ""in-the-money"", so traders take profits and buy more call/put options which causes further hedging which further accelerates the up/down movement in the underlying causing a feedback loop.

\- Market makers see the increased demand for call/put options and increase the price of the high-demand options. This reduces the number of options purchases and the feedback loop eventually loses momentum and stops and then typically reverses in the other direction.

Outcome 2 results in the market makers having a balancing effect on markets by reducing price movement in either direction. 

\- This typically either looks like the prices pinning to a certain level (e.g. SPX pinned to 4700, which on avg had the largest open interest for contracts going into 11/19 OPEX) 

\- Or a long slow gradual melt-up as the hedging flows provide a steady support for the market. (Generally we don't see slow gradual melt-downs b/c price movements tend to increase more quickly in drops. a.k.a generally market takes the stairs up and the elevator down).

**Feedback Loops**

1. Change in market maker hedges impacts underlying stock price.

2. Underlying stock price impacts options prices.

3. Options prices impact market maker hedge.

4. Repeat

This basic feedback loop here is what's referred to when people talk about ""the tail wagging the dog."" in relation to the options market. As we can see above that analogy is not quite accurate, it'd be more accurate to say ""the tail and dog are wagging each other in a feedback loop.""

The main impact of these kinds of feedback loops is that when volumes are large enough, they will overpower more traditional methods of pricing stocks (e.g. fundamentals, macro, etc.). This is not to say that those factors are not playing a role in the price, but rather that they are playing a role within the broader context of these feedback loops. 

If you ignore these feedback loops and use only your traditional methods, you run the risk of getting burned when a feedback loop is exerting pressures in the other direction. This will cause you to look at market and say it's acting ""crazy"" by your traditional methods which may certainly be true, but anytime you and the market disagree on a trend/price just remember: Do you want to be right or do you want to make money?

**In Practice**

Ok ok enough theory, how to use these ideas in your investing/trading?

You can think of options contracts as having gravity on a stock's price. The more contracts at a given price, the more the feedback loop we discussed above will ""pull"" the stock to that price. You can use this as additional info in determining support/resistance/pivots etc.

Since it's impossible to hedge continuously, market makers do it in batches which can cause large buy/sell orders to be entered on the underlying as a hedge shortly after large options prices shifts. When you see large buy/sell volume on an index/equity always ask yourself if it's real volume or if it's hedging volume. If it's hedging volume then it will be rolled back as OPEX(options expiration) nears and the price hasn't shifted much. These hedge rollbacks can be potential reversal opportunities on the underlying.

The above hedging primarily impacts high-volume options like SPX, AAPL, TESLA, etc. Even if your stock doesn't have large options volume, due to the correlation between equities, price moves triggered by SPX options can still indirectly affect your equities if it triggers larger market moves.

Flows are most pronounced near monthly OPEX b/c options price vary much more highly as they get closer to expiration. These causes the hedging flows to also increase as any options price movement requires a change in the underlying hedge. This makes feedback loop effects stronger near OPEX.

Last but not least, since gamma squeezes occur in both directions there is always the risk of a regular pullback/dip turning into a full on rout depending on how options activity behaves at the same time and how stable the underlying market structure is. (e.g. sp bull market with 450/500 climbing stocks much more stable structure than sp bull market with with 250/500 sp climbing stocks, even though both tickers show the number going up.)

**Market Next 2 Weeks**

I think based on the mentioned feedback loops and current options activity the market will continue to drop for the next week(12/6) with the potential for reversal coming the week after (12/13). 

**Week of 12/6**

There is a huge amount of PUTs that have been bought recently causing market makers to sell the underlying as a hedge, and I suspect in that broader context(news on fed taper, omicron, debt ceiling, evergrande default, crypto drop/tether fud, potential bad cpi, etc.) will be enough to increase this feedback loop downward early this week. Based on PUT positioning and the feedback loops pulling price towards large open options positions, I suspect if spy break below 4500 it will drop fast. Best case support holds at 4400. Absolute worst case down to 4000, but I doubt it will get there. 

It's possible we get a small bounce again on Monday before dropping below 4500, but I do expect us to break below this upcoming week.

I am not going to comment on actual real-life risks of those news events I mentioned b/c I don't know. Only that within the fragile context of current options positioning it wouldn't take much bad news to increase the downward momentum and there seem to be a lot of different potential catalysts that could spark fear causing selling given how fewer and fewer crowded stocks currently hold up the major indices.

**Week of 12/13**

This will be a very key week to determine whether a Santa Rally will happen. Ideal scenario for that would be traders overextend on PUTs. Market holds the line and those PUTs expire worthless. Market makers unwind their hedges by buying the underlying stock sling-shotting us back for another rally.

It's also possible we trade sideways here and don't slingshot back. This would be a wait-and-see kind of scenario. 

Either way I think it's unlikely that the market will still be dropping by 12/17 unless one of the aforementioned events results in some more bad news (e.g. omicron being worse than expected, faster fed taper, US institutions holding a bunch of Chinese property debt, Tether finally collapses, etc.) Not saying those are likely, but always good to be aware of worst-case scenarios when managing risk.

**My related positions**

As my positions show I'm quite bearish at the moment.

SPY and QQQ Puts w/ multiple expiries: now - 12/17 w/ multiple strikes: 440 - 460

UVXY calls, strike: 75 expiry: 1/21 (This position is highly speculative on my part and I've had it for a couple of months, not saying we're going to see a crash of this magnitude, but I do personally believe it's in the range of possibility.)

I will likely turn bullish near 12/17 for Santa Rally, will play it by ear as we get closer to decide exactly when.

**Disclaimer/Final Thoughts** 

I'm just some guy on the internet who bets on whether lines go up or down and have 0 formal or otherwise training in any of this. I just happen to play the game. No one(on the internet or otherwise) knows what the market is going to do. Ever. Go look at the finance ""news"" from 11/22/21 on JPow announcement. Same papers give his appointment credit for the market rally in morning and then few hours later blame his appointment for the drop in the afternoon. Absolute clown stuff. They don't know what's going to happen anymore than you or I do. Their job is only to give you ""plausible"" sounding answers you want to hear. Same with reddit/twitter/fb/etc. So they will just take the most recent major event assign it credit/blame and then spin into whichever bull/bear narrative they think you want to hear. For profit market ""commentary"" is the stock market equivalent of selling pickaxes in a gold rush.

If you take nothing else away from this post at least remember this. Markets are chaotic and unpredictable. You can't analyze or research your way out of that basic fact. All you can do in the face of that is accept the uncertainty and play this game accordingly. Uncertain scenarios are both full of risk, but also full of opportunity. Best of luck in the coming weeks, I have no idea what will happen, but at the very least it should be interesting! Cheers.","stocks",39,"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/r9u46e/tail_wagging_the_dog_a_case_for_how_options/"

Stocks extended their streak of underperformance, with the three major indexes falling once again for the fifth consecutive day of losses, one of the worst weeks for equities all year. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.78% down, closing out the week 1.57% down. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) also closed the day 0.78% down, closing the week out 1.3%. The Dow Jones (DIA), which primarily weights financial, industrial, and energy stocks, closed the day 0.75%, closing the week 1.91% lower. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued its roughly year-long streak of underperformance, falling 0.97% and closing the week 2.53% lower. All year, IWM has been trading between a range of $210 and $235, unable to break out, compared to the more than 15% year-to-date gain by the SPY. Market participants remain concerned with the surge in the coronavirus Delta variant and the potential negative impact it could cause the economy.

First off, in geopolitical news, President Biden spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time in months. Afterward, Bloomberg reported that the Biden administration was considering investigating Chinese subsidies and their effect on the US economy. Marc Chandler, Chief Market Strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said The Sino-America relationship is in disrepair and todays call does not seem to change this. The US appears to list actions it wants China to take, while Chinas demands seem minimalist, quit demonizing it and respect its red lines. Yet its red lines strike at the very heart of international order, such as its claims on most of the South China Sea and its aggressive provocative actions in the region. This also comes amid extremely intense regulatory pressures by the CCP on Chinese tech stocks, many of which have an American listing.

In other news, new economic data showed that prices paid by producers for materials once again rose last month, once again highlighting the strain that stills exists as supply-side pressures and labor market shortages once again push inflationary readings higher. This report shows that, despite the pandemic surging once again, demand by consumers remains red-hot and continues to outstrip manufacturing capacity, causing shortages, which, as basic economics shows, pushes prices higher. The producer price index for final demand rose 0.7% last month after two straight monthly increases of 1.0%, the Labor Department said. The gain was led by a 0.7% advance in services following a 1.1% jump in July. A 1.5% increase in trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers, accounted for two-thirds of the broad rise in services. Goods prices jumped 1.0% after climbing 0.6% in July, with food rebounding 2.9%. In the 12 months through August, the PPI accelerated 8.3%, the biggest year-on-year advance since November 2010, though one has to take into account this number is inflated due to easy comparisons to last year, given the absolute collapse of prices during the height of the pandemic before the vaccine existed. Economists had forecast a rise of 0.6% on a monthly basis and 8.2% on a yearly basis, basically in line with reality. 

Mike Loewengart, Managing Director at E-Trade Financial, said of the PPI, Anyone who has bought pretty much everything recently knows that supply chain issues are widespread and inflation is real, so this wont be too much of a surprise for the market. Keep in mind were still in the transitory period where the Fed is not inclined to budge of easy money policies.

Now, this is absolutely massive news and will have huge consequences in the market moving forward, especially for companies who derive a large percentage of their revenue through the Apple Store. Today,  a judge in California sided with Epic Games and issued Apple a permanent injunction against their App Store policies. This move opens the door for developers to offer customers third-party payment options that do not force developers to pay Apples 15-30% commission. Stocks like Roblox (RBLX), Bumble (BMBL), Zynga (ZNGA), and Spotify (SPOT) sharply gapped up after the announcement. I cannot stress how big this is, in 2020 Apple made $73 billion in revenue from the commission on App purchases.

Unfortunately, a summer that began with plunging coronavirus cases nationwide and real hope that the worst of the pandemic was behind us as the effective vaccination drive began is instead drawing to a close with the US firmly in throes of the pandemic once again, due to the highly contagious Delta variant. 

This weekend, hospitalizations were roughly 300% higher than Labor Day weekend in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The surge in patients comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread across the US, and coincided with a weekend that saw a spike in travel. According to the Transportation Security Administration, more than 3.5 million people traveled across the country on Friday and Saturday for the Labor Day holiday, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions recommendation for unvaccinated people to refrain from traveling.

**Highlights**

* Peloton (PTON) shares gapped up after the company announced it was launching an apparel brand. Its probably gonna be the same sort of clothes that are sold in Lululemon (LULU).
* The crackdown in China continues& This time, regulators of video game companies execs to focus less on profits and implement controls to prevent video game addiction. Companies were urged to break from the solitary focus of pursuing profit or attracting players and fans.
* Russian Cybersecurity firm Yandex (YNDX) said it successfully repelled the biggest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in history. This comes just after American company Cloudflare (NET) repelled the previously largest DDoS attack on Aug 19. The Yandex attack was 22 million requests per second, while Cloudflares was 17.2 million requests per second. Cybersecurity is becoming ever more important as attacks become more complex and powerful.
* The Italian Data Authority asks Facebook (FB) to provide clarifications on the use and function of the smart glasses to gauge whether the product is compliant with privacy laws. Like I said yesterday, I think the glasses are a bad product, dont see any use for them apart from very niche uses, like live-streaming. Not even to mention FBs absolutely appalling record when it comes to data privacy (remember Cambridge Analytica?)
* Sales of cars in China fell for the fourth straight month amid the global shortage in semiconductors that have forced automakers across the globe to slash production.
* Elon Musk sent an email to Tesla employees asking them to go super hardcore to make up for production challenges to ensure a decent Q3 delivery number. The CEO also said, This is the biggest wave in Tesla history, but we got to get it done. I hope they get it done, still waiting on my Model 3 :(

Wrote this on Fridays Recap: ""*On a personal note, I am taking this opportunity to do some very small dip buying. As usual I believe the market is overreacting (as it tends to do). While it is important to acknowledge the risks present in the market, and be prepared to act if they arise, I personally believe Omicron fears are overblown (I remember we had the same song and dance when Delta was first discovered). More concerning is the Feds change in attitude towards inflation. That said, the only thing discussed so far has been accelerating the timeline for tapering asset purchases. As I have said for months at this point, I am not worried about tapering. If/when the Fed begins discussing raising interest rates, then I will step back and reassess.""*

*My point with highlighting is this: the market loves to overreact. Do your own research, stick to your convictions, never listen to mainstream media, but be prepared to react to anything. The market loves overreacting, both to the upside and downside, reality is always somewhere in the middle.*

Stocks extend gains from yesterday with a huge bounce today after new Omicron data coming out of South Africa suggests the severity of the variant is less than originally expected and looked ahead towards the monthly Consumer Price Index, set to be released later this week, which will give us more information regarding the pace and potential staying power of inflation. In other news, the Peoples Bank of China recommitted to accommodative monetary policy in the country in an effort to stimulate growth. This is notable at a time when other Central Banks across the world are tightening policy.

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): +2.04%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): 3.01%
* Dow Jones (DIA): +1.38%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +2.30%
* Volatility Index: -15.34%
* Apple (AAPL): +3.54%
* NVIDIA (NVDA): +7.96%
* Ford Motors (F): 3.85%
* NovaVax (NVAX): +28.87%
* Square (SQ): +5.27%

Some encouraging developments about the Omicron variant helped boost risk assets today. During an appearance on CNN today, Fauci said that preliminary data and reports coming out of South Africa, where Omicron was originally discovered November 24, suggest the severity of the virus is not as bad as originally feared. Fauci said, Clearly, in South Africa, omicron has a transmission advantage. And although its too early to make any definitive statements about it, thus far it does not look like theres a great degree of severity to it. But weve really got to be careful before we make any determinations that it is less severe, or really doesnt cause any severe illness comparable to delta, but thus far the signals are a bit encouraging regarding the severity.

Chinas Central Bank cut its capital reserve requirement ratio for banks in the region, meaning they could lend out more money and boost growth. This is interesting given most other Central Banks around the world, including the US, have started tightening monetary policy.

After a massive 25% spike in the Volatility Index (VIX) last week, the fear index lost all its gains in two trading days, a sign that market participants remain bullish and eager to buy up any dips in the market.

Alongside concerns of the Omicron variant, investors have also been ascertaining when and how robustly the Federal Reserve will move to accelerate its asset-purchase tapering program and raise interest rates from their current near-zero levels as inflationary pressures continue to mount. On Friday, the Labor Department is set to release its November Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is expected to show the fastest year-over-year rise in core consumer prices since 1991, at a 4.6% annual gain.

Tech and growth stocks are the longest-duration assets, which means they're going to be the most negatively impacted in valuation by any bump up in inflation which would take interest rates up. But on the other hand, what the Fed is doing and is even talking about doing, which is going from accommodative to more restrictive monetary policy, is known.""

**Highlights**

* Ford Motor (F) said it plans to retire up to $5 billion in high-interest debt and tap into the fast-growing market for ""green"" bonds to help it finance new electric vehicles and expand credit to customers with lower scores.
* Ford partnered with Salesforce (CRM) to launch new SaaS software for Fords commercial and services unit.

* Twitter (TWTR) announced it was acquiring messaging platform Quill in an effort to improve messaging tools in the social media. Based on Salesforce technology, the system will digitize paperwork for contractors, repair technicians and other trades people, and start at $39 per month per user, Ford said.
* Apple (AAPL) signed an agreement with the Chinese government worth an eye-watering $275 billion to placate threats that would hurt their devices and services in the country. As part of the agreement, Apple promised to use more components from Chinese suppliers in its devices, sign deals with Chinese software firms, collaborate on technology with Chinese universities and directly invest in Chinese tech companies.

Stocks traded mixed in the first session of September, which is historically the worse month for equities. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) both eeked out a new intraday record high, closing 0.07% and 0.17% higher respectively. The Dow Jones (DIA) fell 0.10% while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, rose 0.67%. Market participants continue to digest comments from the Federal Reserves annual Jackson Hole Symposium and a key speech from Powell on Friday. Looking ahead, market participants wait for new, crucial economic data, namely the August Job Report, set to be released on Friday. 

Despite some choppiness near the middle of the month, the SPY closed out its seventh straight month of gains, rising nearly 3% during the month of August, bringing the performance of the index to a staggering 20% gain year-to-date. Despite the risk posed by potential inflationary pressures and the coronavirus Delta variant, market participants remain encouraged by the pace of the economic recovery, record corporate earnings, and a still accommodative Federal Reserve.

ADP, a leading human services and payroll management company, released their monthly private job report, which estimated that the US gained 374,000 jobs in August, far short of estimates of 600,000, though an improvement over 326,000 last month. Most of the new jobs came from leisure and hospitality, which added 201,000 positions in a somewhat hopeful sign that an industry beset by a labor shortage continues to recover. Education and health services combined to add 59,000, with employment dented by a surge in Delta variant cases. This sets a backdrop for the offical August Jobs Report, set to be released on Friday. Economists estimate 756,500 jobs will be added, which would represent a slowdown compared to the 943,000 jobs added in July.

Mark Zandi, Chief Economist at Moodys Analytics, said of the report, The delta variant of COVID-19 appears to have dented the job market recovery. Job growth remains strong, but well off the pace of recent months. Job growth remains inextricably tied to the path of the pandemic. 

Ive talked about it the last few days, but here is the full transcript from Powells speech on Friday

* Ford Motors (F) said it is forced to once again trim production due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage. said it will cut two of three shifts at its Dearborn Truck Plant next week, while its Kansas City Assembly Plant F-150 production will be down. This is like the third of fourth time this has happened with no end of the chip shortage in sight. 
* In tangentially related news, Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted that 2021 has been the year of super crazy supply chain shortages and pointed to delays in shipping. Here is the tweet [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1433115031940440065](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1433115031940440065)
* Twitter (TWTR) launched a super follow feature that allows creators to generate monthly revenue by sharing subscriber-only content. The company hopes the future will attain at least $7.5 billion in annual revenue by the end of 2023.
* After a steep sell-off following an intense regulatory crackdown by the CCP, shares of Chinese stocks were moving higher today.

Last week, the Fed signaled that an interest rate hike could come relatively soon, sparking widespread volatility among technology and growth stocks. Moreover, the Feds comments resulted in a sharp rise in the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield, further pressuring high growth stocks.

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital to fund their growth and expansion and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunities to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. While higher yields are generally seen as a bet on a strengthening economic environment, it does make it more expensive to borrow capital, which weighs heavily on growth stocks, which are valued heavily based on future earnings projections.

Looking ahead, there are two big developments to keep in mind. On Tuesday, Jerome Powell will give his confirmation hearing to Congress (he was recently re-elected as Fed chair). He is expected to lay out to lawmakers his expectations for inflation moving forward and signal on what the Fed plans to do. His hearing could potentially spark volatility, so watch out for that.

In addition to Powells confirmation hearing, the Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to release Decembers Consumer Price Index, which is currently expected to show a 7.0% jump in year-over-year prices, the largest jump since 1982. This could also spark more volatility.

At the end of the week, big banks including JP Morgan (JPM), Citigroup, and Wells Fargo (WFC) will earnings Friday morning before the opening bell.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 4, 2021**

After an encouraging day last Friday, the stock market sank once again as market participants continue to closely monitor developments out of Washington and wait for upcoming economic and earnings data to gauge concerns over supply chain disruptions and inflation. Tech stocks once again came under pressure as the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield continues to rise. The Nasdaq (QQQ) close the day 2.1% lower, which means the tech-heavy index is now roughly 8% below its previous all-time high. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed 1.29% lower, the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.92%, and the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 0.91%.

Weve seen previous episodes of rising rates, both earlier this year as well as when the Fed first announced intentions to begin tapering quantitative easing in the not too distant future. Each of these episodes caused a hiccup but didnt derail the broader bull market. According to Edward Jones, yields went from below 1% to 1.75% during the first three months of this year, a period that included pullbacks in the S&amp;P 500 of 3.7% for four days and 4.2% for 12 days. However, during that entire three-month stretch in which rates were rising, the stock market rose more than 7%.  In this current spate, 10-year rates have jumped from 1.30% on September 15 to as high as 1.54% last week, reflecting a renewed concern over inflation pressures and reduced Fed stimulus expectations

Stocks are struggling to regain their footing after the September selloff, given that many of the concerns that sparked last months drop remain. Congressional lawmakers have yet to come to an agreement on a solution to raise the debt limit to prevent a potential government default sometime mid-October. Failure to do so would be catastrophic for the US economy.  As a reminder, Congress successfully averted a government shutdown last week. The House approved a bill late on Wednesday suspending the debt limit through December 2022. The Senate could vote on it as early as this week Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, but Republicans are expected to block it again as they have twice before. This is an evolving situation. In my humble opinion, I think the Republicans are playing political games with the debt ceiling and will pass it last minute, similar to the spending bill to avoid the government shutdown. 

Put simply, a default by the US would be an economic and political disaster that must be avoided. I cannot fathom the government willingly plunging the US into an unprecedented financial crisis for political reasons, though one can never guess the future. According to a report by Moodys Analytics, one of the three big along with Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch Group, approximately 6 million jobs would be lost and the unemployment would spike dramatically, US GDP would decline, and there would be an irrevocable stain on the faith and strength of US financial markets. Internationally, the United States will have for the first time undermined the full faith and credit of its own currency -- a blow to our standing in the world and a boon for our adversaries such as China who are arguing to the world that the US is on the decline

The report goes on to say, Global financial markets and the economy would be upended, and even if resolved quickly, Americans would pay for this default for generations, as global investors would rightly believe that the federal governments finances have been politicized and that a time may come when they would not be paid what they are owed when owed it. To compensate for this risk, they will demand higher interest rates on the Treasury bonds they purchase. That will exacerbate our daunting long-term fiscal challenges and be a lasting corrosive on the economy, significantly diminishing it.

Looking ahead, the September Jobs Report will be released later this week. Market participantsd are hoping to see payroll gains accelerate after a shockingly disappointing August report, which shoed just 235,000 new payrolls gains verses more than 700,000 expected. Consensus economists anticipate that 475,000 payrolls returned in September, and that the unemployment rate fell to 5.1%, or the lowest since March 2020.

**Highlights**

* Facebook (FB) underperformed the market after major outages and disruptions of service were reported across the companys suite of products. 
* Amazon (AMZN) is suffering its worst streak of underperformance in roughly two years and has turned negative year-to-date.
* GlobalFoundries, which was created by the divestiture of the manufacturing arm of AMD reportedly filed for a US IPO.  
* Tesla (TSLA) unexpectedly topped estimates for third-quarter deliveries, despite the global semiconductor shortage that is affecting all automakers. Comparatively, Ford (F) deliveries were down 27.4% in the third quarter. While one cant make direct comparisons due to scale differences, still very impressive to see Tesla (TSLA) successfully navigate the shortage.
* A group of Tesla investors filed a court filing to argue that Elon Musk to repay the company $9.4 billion for the benefits he received after Tesla bought SolarCity, which Musk partly owned. 
* Factory orders were up 1.2% in August month-on-month, [according to Commerce Department data ](https://www.census.gov/manufacturing/m3/prel/pdf/s-i-o.pdf)on Monday. This came in faster than the 1.0% rise expected, according to Bloomberg consensus data, and represented a fourth consecutive monthly advance.
* Qualcomm (QCOM) and investment partnership firm SSW Partners announced an agreement to purchase automobile technology company Veoneer (VNE) Monday morning for $37 a share, which values the company at $4.5 billion","stocks",12,"https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/q1fybu/here_is_a_market_recap_for_today_monday_oct_4_2021/"

Losses in the stock market accelerated today as new data showed an increased number of coronavirus infections in both Europe and the United States. In an effort to combat the disease, countries are once again putting restrictions in place, raising the concern of another lockdown that further harms global economic activity.

The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished the day down 1.82%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 1.5% down and the Dow Jones performed the worst (DIA) finishing 2.21%.

Unfortunately, over the weekend, the US posted consecutive days of record high infection, with more than 80,000 new cases confirmed on Friday and Saturday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. States in the Midwest of the US have been the most affected, most likely due to a resistance by the population to wear masks and colder temperatures.. Over the past seven days, the country reported an average of about 68,767 new cases every day, the highest seven-day average recorded yet, again according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Worryingly, The seven-day average is up more than 22% compared to last week, an extremely worrying increase. Adjusted for population, the Dakotas, Wisconsin, Montana and Idaho are reporting more average daily new cases than anywhere else in the country. Sadly, Johns Hopkins University reported there were 225,111 COVID-19 related deaths across the country as of Sunday afternoon. By comparison, there were 291,557 American soldiers killed in battle during World War II, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

Europe is faring no better, with countries reporting a record number of infections over the weekend and announcing a host of new restrictions. On Sunday, France reported 52,000 positive cases, a record for the country. In response, two-thirds of the country has been placed under strict, 9 p.m. curfew. In Italy, 15,199 new cases of the virus were reported, well above the previous record of 11,705. In response, the Italian government has implemented restrictions, shutting down gyms, pools and movie theaters, putting an early curfew on cafes and restaurants and mandating that people keep wearing masks outdoors. Spain, which has also been struggling with a record number of infections, declared a nationwide state of emergency and imposed a curfew. 

With the November election a mere 8 days away, the chances for the passage of additional virus-relief have all but disappeared. In a letter to her fellow Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi slammed the Republicans for the failure to act in the face of the pandemic, calling their response arrogance. She said, The Republicans continued surrender to the virus - particularly amid the recent wave cases - is official malfeasance. We must come to an agreement as soon as possible. But we cannot accept the \[Trump\] administrations refusal to crush the virus, honor our heroes or put money in the pockets of the American people. That attitude clearly explains why the White House has not embraced the science-based path to crush the virus, which is contained in the Heroes Act. Democrats and the White House have most recently proposed $2.2 trillion and $1.9 trillion relief packages, respectively. Despite the similar target price tags for legislation, the sides still have not resolved disputes over testing, extra unemployment insurance, state and local government relief and liability protections for businesses, among other issues.

Stocks traded higher today, with market participants hoping that lawmakers may succeed in coming to an agreement for more stimulus in the near-term. 

Stocks lost some momentum in the last hour of market, but still ended the day higher overall. The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.21%, the S&amp;P (SPY) finished 0.38% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) ended the day 0.35% up.

Over the weekend, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi set a deadline for today to reach a deal with the Trump administration for an additional round of stimulus before the November election. However, in an interview today, Pelosi downplayed the importance of the deadline she had set, signaling that she is willing to keep talks going. It isnt that this day was a day that we would have a deal, it was a day that we would have our terms on the table to be able to go to the next step. Hopefully by the end of the day today, well know where we stand. In other words, if a bill is to be voted on and passed before the November election, terms need to be agreed and the bill written soon.  Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama responded saying, You never know what's going to happen around here at the last minute but it's getting to be toward the last minute and the clock keeps ticking away. Im not optimistic about doing anything.

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Pelosi are set to continue discussion regarding stimulus today at 3 p.m. easter time, as both officials make a push to come to an agreement very soon. Discussions between the pair have been ongoing for weeks but unfortunately very little progress seems to be made, grappling with disagreements on issues including state and local funding and liability protection, per the Wall Street Journal. Lets hope they are able to come to a decision. 

Pres. Trump also supported the idea of a large, comprehensive stimulus package  saying I want to do it even bigger than the Democrats. Not every Republican agrees, but they will. I want to do it even bigger, because this is money going to people who did not deserve what happened to them.""

**Highlights**

Stocks finished mixed as rising Treasury yields and expectations of higher inflation weighed on equity prices. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed the day modestly green while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and the Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back steeply. The tech-heavy Nasdaq posted its worst performance in more than a month.

Prospects of rising inflation following the coronavirus pandemic have pushed bond prices lower while pushing Treasury yields sharply higher. .The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note briefly ticked above 1.39% on Monday to reach a fresh one-year high. Higher Treasury yields lead banks to place higher on loans in order to offset the effect of inflation. With so much money being pumped into the economy this year, many analysts have warned about rising inflation rates in the post-pandemic economy. However, despite the abrupt spike, Treasury yields remain at historically low levels. Now is not the time to panic, several fundamental factors, such as favorable fiscal and monetary policy and growing corporate earnings, remain in place to support a post-pandemic bull market. Below is a chart of the 10-year Treasury Yield rate made by Bloomberg=÷

The COVID-19 vaccine rollout in the U.S. has so far seen just under 64.2 million doses administered to Americans as of Monday morning, according to an update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Additionally, 75.3 million doses have so far been delivered to states, inclusive of both Moderna's and Pfizer's and BioNTech's vaccines. Last week, the United States averaged 77,665 new coronavirus cases per day, a drop of 43% from the average of two weeks ago according to data analyzed by the New York Times. The drop in cases is staggering given that on January 8, the US recorded more than 300,000 new cases. 

**Highlights**

* A lot of popular EV stocks like Tesla (TSLA), Nio (NIO), Plug Power (PLUG) and many others have been pulling back sharply in recent days. Remember Psychos, many of these stocks were overvalued 1-2 weeks ago, pullbacks like this represent an opportunity.
* After reaching an impressive high of $58,000, Bitcoin (BTC) pulled back around 10% today.
* The dollar slid against major currencies, slumping to multi-year lows against the British pound and the Australian dollar, another sign of rising fears of inflation
* Australia will not alter legislation that would make Facebook and Alphabet Inc's Google pay news outlets for content, a senior lawmaker said on Monday, as Canberra neared a final vote on whether to pass the bill into law. Remember, as of now, Facebook (FB) is not showing any news to its users in Australia.
* Chinas bank regulator on Saturday tightened requirements on the internet loan business of commercial banks, amid heightened scrutiny of online lending by internet giants such as Ant Group, the finance arm of Alibaba Group.

Unfortunately, after a brief bounce in the market yesterday, volatility resumed as market participants continue to contemplate the potential impact of the new coronavirus Omicron variant and new comments by newly re-elected Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Since the new variant was discovered last week, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) erased all its November gains and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed its worst month since April 2020, down more than 4%. 

**Some Notable Numbers Today**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -1.87%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -1.44%
* Dow Jones (DIA) -1.77%
* SPY Bank ETF: -2.24%
* VIX: +15.51%
* AAPL: +3.24%

J. Pows latest remarks before the Senate Banking Committee spooked the markets, after he said he would back off from using the word transitory to describe rising inflation. This is very notable because the Central bank has been using the T-word since the beginning of the year, when it warned that steep differences in year-over-year comparisons and supply-chain bottlenecks would lead to elevated inflation. 

Powell said, We tend to use \[the word transitory\] to mean that it wont leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation. I think its probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean.

Originally, Central Bank officials hoped inflation would begin moderating in the second-half of 2021, something that has not happened. Instead, prices rose 6.2% in October, the fastest annual rise in the Consumer Price Index since 1990. The Personal Consumption Expenditures, which serve as the Feds preferred measure of inflation came in 5% higher. Powell said the risk of higher inflation has increased, but reiterated that his baseline expectation is for inflation to fall closer to the central banks 2% target over the course of 2022.

Adding salt to the wound, vaccine makers released new, less optimistic commentary regarding how effective existing vaccines are against the new Omicron variant. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said their current vaccine would likely see a material drop in effectiveness against the Omicron variant. 

He said, There is no world, I think, where \[the effectiveness\] is the same level	we had with \[the\] Delta \[variant\]. I think its going to be a material drop. I just dont know how much because we need to wait for the data. But all the scientists Ive talked to	.	.	. are like, This is not going to be good.

[https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f](https://www.ft.com/content/27def1b9-b9c8-47a5-8e06-72e432e0838f)

Both Pfizer and Moderna have said they were collecting data on the Omicron variant and that more definitive information would be available in the coming weeks. Researchers have not yet determined whether the new variant is more easily transmitted, or responsible for more severe illness, than previous versions of the virus.

Vivek Paul, BlackRock Investment Institution Chief Investment Strategist said, Information is coming rapidly, it's evolving in real-time. You can understand why investors \[last week\] were taking a little bit of a pause, particularly given the liquidity situation we had going into the U.S. holiday season. We think on balance, it would make sense to be invested in the markets at this moment in time. It's all about understanding whether or not this is a delay, or a derailment, of the restart that we've seen. And it seems most likely at this moment  notwithstanding more information to come that it looks like a delay. I agree, its important to acknowledge risks present in the markets but it is not time to panic yet, we simply do not have enough information yet.

"222","2021-06-28",1624911095,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, June 28, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, June 28, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed today, with the Dow Jones (DIA) underperforming while the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and the Nasdaq (QQQ) kept pushing higher, with each recording new intraday highs, encouraged by the Feds outlook that interest rates wont be raised until 2023. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield fell, hovering near 1.48%, an encouraging sign for equities. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for the June Jobs Report, set to be released this Friday. Consensus economists are looking for payroll gains to accelerate to 700,000 in June with an unemployment rate down slightly to 5.7%, with these metrics improving against May's payroll gains of 559,000 and jobless rate of 5.8%. 

Last week, President Joe Biden announced he had reached an infrastructure agreement with a bipartisan group of senators, which catalyzed a jump in industrial stocks that had been lagging the last few weeks. The deal, which would cost $1.2 trillion over the next five years, commits  $312 billion toward traditional infrastructure priorities such as roads, bridges, public transit, airports and waterways. The bulk of the remainder will be invested in water, broadband and power grid restoration, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House. 

Gabriela Santos, global market strategist at JP Morgan said, The way we're thinking about it is, it has the positive side of the deal in terms of the equity market perspective: More spending on physical infrastructure, electric vehicles, 5G and broadband, without the tax increases which would have been a negative from the equity market perspective. This is certainly a positive especially for the more domestic, cyclical-heavy parts of the market, as well as parts of technology like semiconductors, which are more related to the 5G and the green theme."" 

Moreover, the Federal Reserve released the results of its stress test on US banks, an annual test instituted after the 2008 financial crisis meant to determine the financial health of lenders during an extreme hypothetical financial crisis (not unlike what was experienced last year).The test used a hypothetical severely adverse scenario where the U.S. economy saw GDP shrink by 4%, the unemployment rate rise to 10.75%, and the stock market contract by 55%. In the end, the test showed the 23 largest banks could withstand $474 billion in losses from loans and other positions and still emerge with more than double the minimum required capital.

The results of this stress test are extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Given the clean bill of health, these restrictions have now been fully lifted, paving the way for banks across the board to raise dividends and ramp up stock buyback programs.

Looking ahead, market participants are gearing up for Q2 earnings season, which is expected to be a repeat of Q1 record-setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data  an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher.""

However most people will invest with their monthly or yearly salary. So lets assume you invest 1.000$ each year for 10 years instead of buying all at once:

* 2000 to 2009: 261.45 Shares of QQQ worth 14,641.20$ in year 2011

"224","2021-05-21",1621630982,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, May 21, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, May 21, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) declining modestly after yesterdays rally. Its encouraging to see the market holding on to yesterdays gains following the volatility experienced in recent weeks. It seems overall market sentiment is improving following a surge in inflationary fears after the release of the April Consumer Price Index. The SPY closed 0.08% down, the QQQ closed 0.56% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.36% up.

Markets have recently been shaken by the prospect that a rise in inflation may prompt the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. However, as has been reiterated in the recap before, there are several reasons why a change in monetary policy seems very unlikely. In the Federal Reserves April meeting minutes, participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committees maximum-employment and price-stability goals.  Jerome Powell and other monetary officials have reiterated several times that they want to see a string of strong labor reports before major adjustments to policy are considered. The April Job Reports showed only 266,000 jobs added back to the economy, widely missing analyst expectations and marking a sharp deceleration in job growth from March, bolsters that argument.

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures transitory.

On a slightly sour note, the meeting minutes also noted a number of participants suggested that as the economy continues to quickly, it might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase, which have currently been going at a rate of $120 billion per month. However, this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before. Back in an April 14 meeting, Powell said, We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance. As a reminder, quantitative easing is a process in which the Fed buys government bonds in order to inject money into the economy. It is only natural that as the economy recovers, less money needs to be injected into the economy in this manner. The Federal Reserve gave absolutely no signal it was even considering beginning discussion on raising interest rates, which is what market participants are really concerned about.

* Shares of Nvidia (NVDA), one of the leading semiconductor companies, jumped after the company announced a 4-1 split. This means that after the split goes through, every share of  NVDA will become 4 and the price will adjust accordingly.
* In the midst of surging prices, the housing market has begun showing signs of slowing down. Today, the National Association of Realtors showed that existing home sales fell 2.7% in April compared to the month prior. That is well below the expectation of 1% growth and may be a sign the rise in prices may be slowing in the near-term. However, compared to April 2020, existing home sales are up 33.9%.

The stock market fell sharply today, erasing yesterdays gains to close out one of the worst weeks and worst month since March. Volatility has dominated markets in the last few weeks, with investors spooked by the uncertainty of the US presidential elections, a record number of coronavirus infections in the US and Europe, and a new wave of lockdowns across Europe.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) performed the worst, ended the day 2.54% down, the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) ended the day 1% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) 0.52% down.

Yesterday after-hours, heavily-weighted tech companies, like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Facebook (FB) reported their quarterly earnings. Though most reported third-quarter results that exceeded expectations, shares of these companies (except Alphabet) pulled back steeply today. After the strong performance of these stocks compared to the broader market this year, market participants had set their expectations exceptionally high. In other words, traders expected these companies to beat expectations by a much greater margin than they did. The earnings results for all these companies can be found in yesterdays issue of the daily recap. 

Today, the Federal Reserve announced it lowered the minimum loan size for its Main Street lending program to $100,000 from $250,000 and that fees have been adjusted to encourage the provision of these smaller loans. Demand for the lending program has been weak thus far, with the Fed having offered just 400 loans totaling $3.7 billion, out of the total $600 billion capacity. As many pundits have pointed out, many small- and mid-sized businesses have stayed on the sidelines from taking on more loans that they would eventually need to pay back during the pandemic.

Unfortunately, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, there were 88,521 new coronavirus infections reported in the US yesterday, another record, and 9,540 more cases than were reported Wednesday. The trend this week is worrying, given that only last Friday, the US set its previous record for daily new infections. According to the Washington Post, The total number of infections reported nationwide since February is virtually guaranteed to reach 9 million on Friday, just 15 days after the tally hit 8 million. At least 228,000 deaths have been linked to the coronavirus in the country.

Europe is in the thralls of a second surge in coronavirus, with the continent now accounting for 46% of global cases and nearly a third of total deaths. According to World Health Organization (WHO) Spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris, compared to last week, daily cases in Europe have risen by about a third and daily deaths by close to 40% this week. This month, both France and Spain have declared states of emergency, imposing more restrictions to try to ease up pressure on hospital ICU departments. In France, the worst-hit country, more than half of ICU beds are occupied by COVID-19 patients, according to the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.

Today is the last Friday before the US presidential election on Tuesday. Regardless of political leanings, the results of this election are sure to have a massive effect on the stock market, itll be interesting to see how markets react to whatever the US decides.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, October 20, 2021**

***Quick rant:*** *Its remarkable how quickly market sentiment changes. It seems two weeks ago, everyone was predicting an imminent market crash and, in many occasions, going as far as insulting my intelligence for presenting a different viewpoint and remaining bullish even during the height of the Evergrande situation and a looming US debt default. Now it seems the doomsaying posts and articles have all but disappeared. The market has dipped significantly roughly 5-6 times this year and every time it happens I see the same upswell of doomsaying articles and market crash predictors. Not to go on a rant, but it amazes me how willing people are to fight against the trend. Like Ive said, it is important to acknowledge risks present in the market and be prepared to react to the unforeseen, but I dont get why people decide to consciously decide to fight market trends, it is much easier and more profitable to just ride them until you cant anymore. Theres a saying that goes, pessimists sound smart, optimists make money. I have found this saying to be true.* 

The incredible rally in the stock market continued, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) climbing seven straight days to claw back the losses suffered in September when the index dipped -5% from highs for the first time all year. While the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly today, the index has rocketed more than 6% higher from the lows on October 4, a stunning comeback. The Dow Jones (DIA) reached a new intraday all-time high, carried by continued strength in financial stocks. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, traded modestly higher today. Market participants remain encouraged by stronger-than-expected corporate profits amid ongoing supply-chain pressures.

Very strong corporate earnings reports from bellwethers like big banks, Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), and Procter and Gamble (PG) have assuaged fears that corporate profits would slow down dramatically amid supply chain constraints. As the earnings season kicked off, market participants were nervous that ongoing inflationary pressures, labor market imbalances, and congestions issues at ports would greatly weigh on corporate profits. So far, that has not proven to be the case. 

Jon Adams, Senior Investment Strategist at BMO Capital Markets said, We think investorshave been too pessimistic on earnings expectations. It does look like Q2 was likely the peak, but Q3 is going to be strong, probably above 30% year-over-year growth. We think the strength will continue into the fourth quarter, were not overly concerned about profit margins. We are closely monitoring supply chain issues and increasing wage pressures but still think that profit margins are at healthy levels, and that there's more upside to come.""

**Highlights**

* The price of & reached new all-time highs, breaking $65k for the first time after the first-ever ETF was launched in the market yesterday.
* Sharers of Pinterest (PINS) rocketed higher after Bloomberg reported that PayPal (PYPL) was considering acquiring the company for $70 a share (roughly $39 billion). Shares of PINS were up more than 10% while shares of PYPL fell after the report was released.
* Adobe (ADBE) says it expects holiday-period online sales to reach an all-time high of $207 billion from November 1 to December 31 in the US. That would represent a jump of 10% YoY. The company says it expects global online sales to reach $910 billion, also a record.
* The 30-year fixed mortgage rate increased to 3.23% for the week ended Oct. 15, according to a weekly update from the Mortgage Bankers Association. This is the highest level in six months and higher than the 3.18% during the prior week. 
* Facebook (FB) will change its name in order to reflect itself as a metaverse company. As a reminder, the metaverse is a shared, 3D virtual space in which people can interact with the environment and other via online avatars accessed using virtual reality technology.

Stocks finished the day mixed, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) falling while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) pushed higher, closing 0.31% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 0.46%. Market participants are digesting the release of the August Jobs Report, which showed a sharp deceleration in employment amid the latest surge by the coronavirus Delta variant. 

The Labor Department released their monthly unemployment report, which showed hiring in August slow down dramatically as the US continues to battle massive spikes in coronavirus Delta cases in certain parts of the country, mainly the South/Southeast (according to the CDC, roughly S of all COVID-related hospitalizations are in Texas and Florida as both states deal with record coronavirus cases and low hospital capacity). Due to this surge and the reimposition of pandemic-era restrictions in areas with high transmission rates, employment numbers came in shockingly low compared to estimates and the previous months numbers. Here are the numbers.

* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** \+235,000 vs. +733,000 expected and a revised +1.053 million in July
* **Unemployment rate, August:** 5.2% vs. 5.2% expected and 5.4% in July
* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.6% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% in July 
* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 4.3% vs. 3.9% expected and 4.0% in July

President Biden said of the report, While I know some wanted to see a larger number today and so did I, what weve seen this year in continued growth, month after month, in job creation. This is the kind of growth that makes our economy stronger.

This is a little confusing but follow me here. In a weird quirk of the market, the low employment numbers actually benefit equities by staving off the need for tapering, which is why we saw tech stocks in particular popping today. Members of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially close at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the substantial further progress mark the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, I think that one more good job report if its in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering. Regardless, as I have said before, I remain unconcerned by taper talks, I think the real test for equities will come when discussion about potential interest rate hikes begins.

Steve Sosnick, Chief Strategist at Interactive Brokers, said of the report What were seeing is the market really trying to wrestle with the idea of what matters to it more: Is it about the economy, or is it about monetary policy? Now, weve been in a monetary-driven market for so long its hard to say that monetary factors arent at the forefront of the markets mindset right now. But what I think we may be seeing here & we cant really figure out whether this delays tapering in a meaningful way. But theres stuff in here that is not necessarily bad other than the headline number. Wages are good, the unemployment rate is good.

**Highlights**

* Moderna (MRNA), Workday (WDAY), Nvidia (NVDA) were among the best-performing stocks in the Nasdaq today, driving it higher.
* US auto safety regulators disclosed they are investigating a July 26 fatal crash involving a Tesla that may or may not have been using the advanced driver assistance system. This is the latest regulatory headache for Tesla and their autonomous driving technology given there is already another investigation currently underway.
* Dishs (DISH) Sling TV, which reportedly has 2.7 million subs as of December 2020, has partnered with Penn National Gaming (PENN) to launch a Barstools Sports Channel on its streaming service. 
* Match Group (MTCH), which owns popular dating app Tinder, filed a letter with Dutch competition regulators to public state their decision regarding a complaint filed against Apple for anti-competitive practices for forcing Match to use Apples in-app payment system. Ever since Fortnite-maker Epic Games original lawsuit against Apple regarding this seems more and more companies are hopping on. A new South Korean law that was recently passed forces Apple and Google to accept third-party payment systems.
* Amid regulatory crackdown and a falling stock price, Alibaba (BABA) committed to spending the equivalent of roughly $15.5 billion by 2025 towards the Chinese Communist Partys drive to common prosperity.

# **The market rally will soon be tested by a big Trump speech and testimony from the Fed chief  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/08/the-market-rally-will-soon-be-tested-by-a-big-trump-speech-and-testimony-from-the-fed-chief.html)**
*****
&gt; Progress in trade talks and a steady, but accomodative Fed policy have eased the way for the stock markets rally to new highs, and both will be in the forefront when President Donald Trump and Jerome Powell speak at separate events in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Against a backdrop of a stabilizing global economy, stocks have hit new highs and bond yields have pushed higher, particularly in the past week with a 23 basis point surge in the 10-year Treasury yield. Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year rose to end the week at 1.94%, its highest closing level since Aug. 1, the day Trump threatened another round of tariffs on China.
*****
&gt; Trump speaks to the Economic Club of New York during a Tuesday luncheon, and investors are hoping for clarity on a possible trade deal. The Fed chairman speaks Wednesday to the Congressional Joint Economic Committee, and he also appears before the House Budget Committee Thursday.
*****
&gt; There are a few key economic reports, including CPI on Wednesday and retail sales and industrial production on Friday. Empire State manufacturing survey Friday could provide a fresh look at the manufacturing sector in the New York region. Just a few major earnings are expected in the week ahead, including Cisco Wednesday and Walmart and NVIDIA on Thursday.
*****
&gt; But trade is likely to remain the more important wild card for markets, as the calendar edges closer to Dec. 15, the date new tariffs on consumer goods from China would go into effect if there is no deal. The House of Representatives also hold impeachment hearings before the public for the first time in the coming week, but the markets have so far ignored the topic and see it unlikely that the Senate would convict the president.
*****
&gt; # Stock records
&gt; Stocks continued to rally to new highs this past week, and the major indices all ended the week at record levels, as bonds sold off hard. Stock market gains were limited part of the session Friday after Trump said that he has not agreed to the tariff rollbacks sought by China.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 was higher for a fifth week, up 0.9%, and is now up about 1.8% for November so far. The S&amp;P closed at 3,093 Friday.
*****
&gt; President Trump is always unpredictable, so well have to see what he says, said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA.
*****
&gt; Keon expects a trade agreement of some sort in the near future, and that should help risk markets to advance.
*****
&gt; The way weve been interpreting this is it probably amounts to a truce. The United States has been using this rhetoric that its a phase one deal. China has not embraced the same rhetoric. So I dont know if well get major progress on the thornier issues in the first deal, Keon said. The other question is how hard does the president push in an election year to make further progress in the negotiations, given that China might dig in its heels? Thats unknowable. I have no insight into what the president is going to do.
*****
&gt; Cowen policy strategist Chris Krueger said Trumps address Tuesday could be important for the direction of a deal. In our minds, the most critical sections will deal with trade and whether Trump is favoring the phase one deal with China and a scheduled rollback of the tariffs. This could well be a trial balloon to gauge the ferocity of expected pushback from influential China hawks. Trump will give remarks and then take questions from two moderators, wrote Krueger.
*****
&gt; Powells testimony is not expected to have as much potential to rock markets, after the clear message he sent to markets following the Feds rate cut Oct. 30.
*****
&gt; I would expect the chairman to continue the rhetoric he had at his last press conference. Theyre probably on hold. It will depend on the data. If anything the data looks a little more promising on the margin. Certainly the consumer and service sector appear to be doing fine and with the GM strike ending, some of the things impacted by that should improve, said Keon. They think rates are appropriate for now, and if the economy weakens, theyll be prepared to take further action.
*****
&gt; The health of the global economy has been a topic of concern in markets for months, but with the global rise in yields and signs of improvement in global PMI data, investors have clearly become more optimistic.
*****
&gt; Ive been kind of skeptical most of the year, but I do think at the margin, the economic outlook has improved, especially outside the United States, said Keon. The recession talk that was pretty active just a month or two ago has really died down. The yield curve is dramatically uninverted. I feel a little better about the economic outlook.
*****
&gt; When the yield curve becomes inverted, short term rates, like the 2-year note yield for instance, rise above the long end, or the 10-year yield. That is very often a recession warning, as investors bet that the economy will be weaker in the longer term than it is in the near term. But theres been a sudden shift, and now those curves are getting steeper.
*****
&gt; Keon said the higher yields are a positive sign, and he is adding to stock holdings, but more in foreign names. The sense Europe was heading into a recession has died off, and there are signs things are stabilizing, he said. This could all change in a minute but it looks like the overall outlook has significantly picked up in the last month or two.
*****
&gt; Dan Suzuki, portfolio strategist at Richard Bernstein Advisors, said he is still cautious about the improvement, though earnings were not as bad as expected, the Fed has cut rates and the trade situation appears to be improving. That combined with green shoots on the macro front, the markets have really taken that and run with it, he said, adding the move may have been too optimistic. Its out-sized relative to the significance of the data.
*****
&gt; Suzuki said he needs to see more proof that U.S. manufacturing has stabilized, as many believe. ISM manufacturing was better in October than in September, but it is still in contraction. Why is this definitely the bottom? The jurys still out, he said.
*****
&gt; I think you have to answer the questionif this is the bottom and growth is going to rebound here, whats going to be the catalyst for that?...I dont see anything in the data that suggests theres going to be a big rebound for any of those fronts. I see more headwinds to growth than I see tail winds, he said. On the investment side, it would be highly unusual to see a big rebo

# November Expiration Week: S&amp;P 500 &amp; DJIA Best

&gt; DJIA has been up 10 of the last 15 years on Monday of expiration week and Friday is up 13 of the last 17 years with an average gain of 0.45%. By the way, it is not a mistake that November Op-Ex day has the same point change and percent change in 2014 and 2015. It was triple checked and its correct. If you go out 2 more decimal places in the percentage calculation, its different.

&gt; S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have not been as bullish as DJIA around or on November option expiration. S&amp;P 500 has advanced only 16 times during options expiration week while NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have climbed only 15 and 14 times respectively over the past 25 years. All four indices have posted average losses on Monday and aside from DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have been essentially mixed on options expiration day. Fridays solid average gains across the board are largely due to a sizable gain in 2008. Any weakness next week could be a good entry point for new longs ahead of the usually bullish Thanksgiving holiday.

# S&amp;P 500 Price vs 50-DMA

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 has been on a seemingly uninterrupted run higher over the last several days, but by some measures, it may not be as extended as you would think. The chart below shows the historical percentage spread between the S&amp;P 500 and its 50-day moving average (DMA) over the last three years. Through Thursday's close, the S&amp;P 500 was 3.2% above its 50-DMA, which is relatively high but nowhere near an extreme. The red line in the chart below shows the current percentage spread between the S&amp;P 500's price and its 50-DMA. There have been a number of times since the 2016 election where this spread was higher with the most recent being back in July. In fact, 17% of all prior days in the last three years have seen the S&amp;P 500 close at a higher level relative to its 50-DMA than it is now. That doesn't mean the market isn't overbought, but it's not exactly at unprecedented levels either.

# Leaders and Laggards Since FOMC

&gt; We've now had nearly a full week of trading since last Wednesday's FOMC meeting where Fed Chair Powell suggested that the punch bowl isn't going to be taken away anytime soon. During that time, we've seen a real shift in leadership as defensive sectors have sold off while cyclical sectors have been on fire. Energy - yes, Energy - has been the top-performing sector with a gain of 3.5% while Industrials aren't far behind with a gain of 2.8%, Behind these two, Technology and Financials have also comfortably outperformed the S&amp;P 500's gain of 1.2%. On the downside, Real Estate and Utilities, two of the market's most popular sectors for much of 2019 due to their dividend yields, have both dropped over 1% while Consumer Staples and Health Care have also sold off.

&gt; Due to the fact that we are also in the thick of earnings season, it's a bit more difficult to see how the Fed's actions last week impacted individual stocks as some of the best and worst performances over the last week have been earnings-related. With that caveat, the tables below list the best and worst-performing S&amp;P 500 stocks over the last week. Starting off with the winners, three S&amp;P 500 stocks are up over 20% in the last week, and all three were due to earnings reports. Overall, 12 stocks have rallied over 10%, while all 25 of the top performers are up over 7%. In terms of sector representation on the list, nearly a third (8) of the stocks on the list are from the Technology sector, while another five come from the Consumer Discretionary sector. The remaining 12 stocks on the list come from five different sectors.

&gt; On the downside, 8 of the 25 worst performers since last week's FOMC meeting are down over 10% with Arista Networks (ANET) losing nearly a quarter of its value. Again, ANET's decline was tied to an earnings report as opposed to a reaction to the FOMC. In terms of overall sector representation, though, the underperformance of the Real Estate sector highlighted above is also evident on this list as eight of the companies listed come from that sector.

# The Few, the Lowly, the Laggards

&gt; With less than two months left to go in 2019, the S&amp;P 500 is sitting on a gain of nearly 23% YTD, and all but two of the index's 24 industry groups are up by at least double-digit percentages. The two laggards are Energy (+4.5%) and Drugs and Biotechs (+5.5%), while the three strongest groups are all from the Technology sector (Tech Hardware: +44.8%, Semis: +37.7%, and Software: +32.8%). Surprisingly enough, Banks are even starting to move up the performance list as that group is up just a hair under 30% on the year putting it in fifth place on a YTD basis.

&gt; The table below lists where each of the S&amp;P 500's Industry Groups is currently trading with respect to its 50-DMA. While you would expect just about everything to be extended after the recent leg higher, that's not the case. The S&amp;P 500 as a whole is just 3% above its 50-DMA, and just five groups are more than 5% above their 50-DMAs. The two most extended groups are Tech Hardware (think Apple) and Banks. On the downside, there are actually as many Industry Groups trading below their 50-DMAs as there are groups trading more than 5% above their 50-DMAs. As shown at the bottom of the table, Consumer Services, Real Estate, Household &amp; Personal Products, Commercial Services, and Utilities are all currently below their 50-DMAs. These aren't groups that have been lagging the market all year. In fact, three of them are outperforming the S&amp;P 500 on a year to date basis, but in the majority of cases, these are defensive-oriented groups that have fallen out of favor as the market's sentiment has shifted and rates have risen.

# Seasonally Strong Period, But&

&gt; As I head to Las Vegas for my annual pilgrimage to @MoneyShows TradersEXPO I am both thrilled and shocked to hear everybody on Wall Street and the financial media talking about bullish yearend market seasonality and practically every one of them has used the phrase, seasonally strong period.

&gt; Im thrilled because it validates what we already know and what I live and breathe: that there are clear evidence-based results of real, consistent, tradable and investable seasonal market patterns. I am shocked at how late many of them are to the party. Weve been in bullish Best Six Months mode since our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal on October 11.

&gt; Since our October 11 Buy Signal we have tactically maneuvered out of our defensive positions in Bonds, Cyclicals, Utilities and others and into the main U.S. equity index ETFs: DIA, SPY, QQQ and IWM and the gamut of seasonally strong growth sectors over three weeks ago. We also put out a brand new Stock Basket of undervalued growth stocks under Wall Streets radar.

&gt; Market seasonality is clearly firing on all pistons as it has been all year, but everyones is jumping on the seasonal bandwagon just a two regular seasonal soft patches are about to come around on the calendar. Now that our Bullish Halloween Trading Strategy is complete with some big market gains at the end of October and the beginning of November we are on the lookout for weakness ahead of Thanksgiving.

&gt; Next week is two weeks before Thanksgiving and weve shown in several recent posts, it is part of the mid-November soft patch. Then stocks usually pick up in anticipation of Thanksgiving and continue to rally through the end of November. After thanksgiving watch out, the first couple weeks of December are notoriously choppy and not especially bullish as tax-loss selling kicks into high gear.

&gt; With the market elevated and the news ever changing, stocks will be vulnerable to these perennial weak spots.

# Presidential Cycle Stars Align for Stocks in 2020

&gt; Despite all of the geopolitical events, things still look good for stocks next year with an incumbent running. The potential for a decent trade truce with China, along with an economy thats still growing and accommodative interest rates add up to a continuation of the bull market.

&gt; With the Stock Traders Almanac 2020 coming off the press this week heres a little preview of some our analysis and outlook thats in the 53rd Annual Edition.

&gt; Presidential incumbency is a powerful phenomenon and the driving force behind the 4-Year Presidential Election Cycle. This quadrennial quadrille is what has made the Pre-Election Year the best year of the cycle and Election Year second best. Since 1952 S&amp;P 500 is up 12.5% on average in election years when a sitting president is running for reelection vs. 6.7% in all election years and 1.5% in election years with an open field and no incumbent commander-in-chief running for a second term.

&gt; We are also arguably now experiencing some fiscal and monetary policy synchronicity. After several years of conflicting policy the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Federal government are finally getting in synch. Interest rates are historically low and the Fed has lowered rates again at the last three scheduled FOMC meetings at the same time as fiscal policy has been lowering taxes and increasing spending. These dual pro-growth policies should continue to propel the stock market higher.

&gt; Gains will of course not come without pause and correction. The world stage will continue to feature some challenging geopolitical, political, diplomatic, trade-related and economic storylines. U.S. presidential campaign politics will increasingly focus on domestic political disputes, standoffs and unfinished business  as well as impeachment proceedings. But when all is said and done, we expect 2020 to be a positive year based on the historical patterns and cycles and current favorable policies, healthy economics, and positive market behavior.

# Pre-Election Year Patterns: A November Market Pause

&gt; Now that weve survived Octoberphobia and the market has begun to strengthen again, breaking out above resistance and logging new highs on DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ, we are likely to experience a bit of consolidation here in November. Normally the top S&amp;P month of the year and #2 for DJIA, NASDAQ and the Russell 2000, November has been weaker in Pre-Election Years.

&gt; As you can see in the updated chart of Pre-Election Year Seasonal Patterns overlaid with 2019 we have been tracking all year November tends to be flat in the Pre-Election Year with a pop around Thanksgiving. Then after the usual first half of December softness the market tends to push toward additional new highs near yearend. Considering the banner performance so far this year and the uncanny tracking of this historical seasonal pattern, we expect the stock to consolidate over the next few weeks and then resume its march higher.

# Bulls Stay in Motion

&gt; An object in motion tends to remain in motion along a straight line unless acted upon by an outside force. Sir Isaac Newton

&gt; What a year it has been for the bulls. The S&amp;P 500 Index recently made four more new highs, and its up more than 20% for the year (as of Nov. 4). This leads to the big question: What could happen in the final two months of 2019? Well, we think the bulls might like it.

&gt; A good year tends to see continued strong performance the final two months of the year, explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. In fact, when the S&amp;P 500 has been up 20% or more for the year heading into the usually bullish November, stocks have never dropped in November, while December also has tended to see a strong upward bias.

&gt; As the LPL Chart of the day shows, going back to 1950, when the S&amp;P 500 was up more than 20% heading into November, then the final two months were up an average of 6.2%. The S&amp;P 500 has also never fallen in the final two months of the year after closing October up more than 20% for the year.

&gt; This phenomenon could be due to portfolio managers buying to play catch-up, or it could be that an object in motion stays in motion, as Newton noted more than 300 years ago.

"232","2021-08-09",1628543411,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, August 9, 2021","**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, August 9, 2021**

Stocks finished mixed today, with the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) both pulling back from all-time highs last week, pressured by a broad decline in crude energy stocks. The Nasdaq (QQQ) rose modestly. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 0.55%.  Like I have been saying the last few weeks, I expect the market to be quite choppy moving forward, as market participants continue to balance record-breaking corporate earnings and the expectation for economic expansion with rising concerns surrounding the coronavirus Delta variant and inflation. 

Oil prices fell over 2% to a three week low, extending recent losses in the sector as concerns that pandemic-era restrictions may be reinstated across Asia, especially China, which would reduce demand. In the face of rising cases, the worlds second largest economy has extended its border closure and implemented new travel restrictions between areas of high transmission and imposed widespread testing. Chinas National Health Commission said it confirmed 125 new infections as of Sunday - the third straight day it reported 90 cases and above. Of the newly confirmed cases, 71 were locally transmitted, said the health commission. 

While those numbers are very small, it is important to note that the Chinese government has a so-called zero-COVID approach, meaning the government is sure to act very aggressively, much more than is feasible in Western countries, to stamp out the virus. Already, this week we've seen airline seat capacity in China plummet 32% compared to the week prior, the most since the early days of the pandemic. In an article circulated throughout state-sponsored media, Former Health Minister Gao Qiang wrote, Is it feasible to coexist with the virus? The author believes that it is definitely not feasible. The coexistence with the virus \[seen in\] Britain, the United States and other countries has already brought serious consequences to global efforts to contain the epidemic. We must not repeat the same mistakes. I wouldnt be surprised to see more and more restrictions implemented across China, despite the relatively low numbers they have so far. 

Neil Shearing, Chief Economist at Capital Economics wrote in a note, Virus numbers are still very low compared to other countries. But the spread of the Delta variant calls into question Chinas zero-COVID approach. Whereas most governments are now starting to acknowledge that we are likely to have to live with the coronavirus for the long term, Chinas ambition remains to keep it out of the country altogether. Without a shift in approach, this suggests that China will have to continue with occasional local lockdowns and restrictions on movement. This in turn will prevent a full return to pre-pandemic norms of consumer and business behavior, and is likely to mean that restrictions on foreign travel remain in place for some time to come.""

In response, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS) slashed their growth outlooks for the near-future. For example, Goldman slashed its third-quarter real gross domestic product forecast to 2.3% from 5.8%, but lifted its fourth-quarter growth forecast to 8.5% from 5.8%.

However, while the Delta variant does pose a risk to global growth rates, in the US, the economy continues to recover at a remarkable rate. The Labor Departments July Jobs Report marked an unexpected upswing in employment, with the economy adding 943,000 jobs to the 845,000 expected. The unemployment rate was 5.4%, also better than the 5.7% expected. With the coronavirus Delta variant forcing some parts of the US to reinstate some pandemic-era measures, like indoor mask mandates, market participants were closely waiting for this unemployment report. Like I said yesterday, this Job Report was a bit of a wild card, with estimates fluctuating widely from 330,000 to the high 900,000s. Earlier in the week a report by ADP suggested private payrolls were much weaker than expected, with only 330,000 private payrolls added versus the 700,000 expected. On the other hand, Bloomberg economists estimated a gain of more than 900,000 jobs. Happy to see the report come in so positive, a great sign, that despite headwinds remaining, the labor market continues to recover. 

As of Friday, 89% of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) have reported earnings, with 87% of those topping estimates for earnings-per-share, according to data from FacSet. If this proportion holds, it would be the highest percentage of companies beating earnings since at least 2008, when FactSet began to track this data.

**Highlights**

* Followng Penns acquisition of the Score Media last week, DraftKings (DKNG) bought Golden Nugget Online Gaming (GNOG) for $1.56 billion
* Shares of Moderna (MRNA) continued their remarkably strong performance, gapping up more than 17% on the day. Stock up 200% in the last 3 months. 
* At the median, consumers expect inflation to rise by 4.8% over the next year,[ according to the New York Federal Reserve's monthly survey. ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-consumers-near-term-inflation-150329998.html)This matched June's reading, which was the highest level in the survey's history.  For the next three years, consumers expect inflation to rise by 3.7%, ticking up slightly from the 3.6% print from June and reaching the fastest pace expected since 2013.
* Job openings in the US were at a record-high in June, underscoring the way labor shortages and supply-side disruptions are capping the pace of recovery. 
* Car-rental company Hertz announced much stronger than expected corporate earnings this quarter and announced the intentions to re-list. I find this very funny, in my opinion, Hertz is one of the original meme stocks.
* After a brief period of underperformance, financial stocks have been rallying in the last few days. 
* **\*\*Please note that the current stock price was written premarket and may not reflect closing prices.\*\***
* Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) target raised by TD Securities from $63 to $70 at Buy. Stock currently around $57

The stock market sank on Wednesday, pressured by a sell-off in technology stocks, as market participants digest the Feds latest meeting, which suggests an interest raise hike could happen relatively soon. As a result, growth stocks and technology stocks harshly pulled back. On the other hand, the Dow Jones (DIA) recorded a fresh intraday record high in the morning before slipping in the afternoon to close lower.

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&amp;P 500 (SPY): -1.92%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -3.07%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -1.03%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -3.39%
* Tesla (TSLA): -5.35%
* Roku (ROKU): -11.72%
* NVIDIA (NVDA): -5.96%
* Microsoft (MSFT): -3.89%
* Alphabet (GOOG: -4.51%
* Rivian (RIVN): -11.22%
* Block (SQ): -8.21%

The meeting minutes from the Feds December monetary policy meeting suggest the Central Bank was considering accelerating the timeline for a potential interest rate hike amid strengthening economic recovery and elevated inflation.

The meeting minutes said, Participants generally noted that, given their individual outlooks for the economy, the labor market, and inflation, it may become warranted to increase the federal funds rate sooner or at a faster pace than participants had earlier anticipated. Some participants also noted that it could be appropriate to begin to reduce the size of the Federal Reserves balance sheet relatively soon after beginning to raise the federal funds rate.""

Moreover, the minutes said, Almost all participants agreed that it would likely be appropriate to initiate balance sheet runoff at some point after the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.

Here is the entire meeting minutes: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20211215.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20211215.pdf)

Treasury yields jumped to build on gains after moving sharply higher on Monday and Tuesday, which had added pressure to technology and growth stocks. The benchmark 10-year jumped to a 9-month high following the release of the Fed's meeting minutes Wednesday afternoon.

Scott Kimbal, Co-Head of Fixed Income for BMO Global Asset Management said, Yields are moving sharply higher ... or in the very recent past, but they've been stubbornly lower when you compare them to what the inflationary talk has been. There's been lots of discussion about runaway inflation, the Fed being behind the curve. All of that would translate into a long-end  the 10, 20, 30-year portion of the yield curve  that's a lot steeper, or materially higher even in absolute terms than it is right now.""

This morning, market participants digested a fresh upbeat labor market report, which showed private payroll gains handily beat estimated for December. ADP, a leading data processing company, that private-sector employers added back 807,000 jobs during the final month of November,  well ahead of the Dow Jones estimate for 375,000 and the November gain of 505,000.

Hiring was broad-based, though leisure and hospitality led with 246,000 new positions. Trade, transportation, and utilities contributed 138,000, professional and business services increased by 130,000, and education and health services added 85,000.

While service-related professions led with 669,000 new hires, the goods-producing side also showed strong gains with manufacturing rising 74,000.

Nela Richardson, Chief Economist at ADP, said Decembers job market strengthened as the fallout from the Delta variant faded and Omicrons impact had yet to be seen. Job gains were broad-based, as goods producers added the strongest reading of the year, while service providers dominated growth.

[https://adpemploymentreport.com/2021/December/NER/NER-December-2021.aspx](https://adpemploymentreport.com/2021/December/NER/NER-December-2021.aspx)

Following the ADP release, Goldman Sachs raised its estimate for the December nonfarm payrolls count to 500,000, a 50,000 increase from its prior estimate.

As I have said multiple times before, I remain bullish until the Fed begins raising interest rates. Now that the Fed seems to be accelerating its timeline, its time to reassess. While I think the pullback the last two days is overdone, I do think market conditions are shifting. I remain bullish in the long-term but expect a lot more choppiness compared to the last two years. Trades should be quicker, with tighter profit targets and stops.

**Highlights**

* The Omicron variant continues to surge across the US, with the country once again recording a new record high. On January 4, the US reported 885,451 new coronavirus infections, more than tripling the peak of any of the previous surges.
* Ford Motors (F) stock recently jumped more than 10% after the company announced it planned to double production of the electric F-150 Lightning pickup truck.
* Ford also reported sales for 2021 fell 6.8% compared to 2020 but had a very strong fourth-quarter, a sign that demand could begin to pick up. Ford sold 508,451 vehicles in the fourth quarter, a 27% increase over the previous quarter
* Meta Platforms (FB) has ceased development of a new VR/AR software operating system that employed more than 300 after four years. Meta quickly issued a statement via Gabriel Aul, its vice president of Reality Labs Engineering. ""There are several technical directions we're pursuing in our efforts to build the operating systems, we're still working on a highly specialized OS for our devices - we remain very much invested in this work and continue to dedicate the resources necessary to build this.
* GM Chief Executive Mary Barra told the annual CES technology conference via video on Wednesday that the electric Silverado will launch in two stages in 2023.
* WarnerMedias HBO Max streaming service gained subscribers through the holidays, defying the slowing pace of growth at some rival services. HBO ended the year with 73.8 million subscribers to its streaming service and namesake cable network, up from 69.4 million in September.

"234","2018-10-26",1540550023,"Not actively investing, portfolio getting crushed.","Hi Guys,

Its a shame to say that I am down \~16% all time (starting from August, 2017), especially in the bull market that has been going for quite some time. It wasn't always like this--for a majority of the time that I've been investing I've had pretty solid returns. I made some investments that I now regret (specifically MU @52), and being in college now, I have been almost too busy to keep up with my portfolio. I am now at a point where I've suffered through some pretty tough losses and I am not sure what steps to take going forward. I don't know whether to sell for a loss, or hold longer term and break even (hopefully).

**My current portfolio consists of the following:**

* MU-32.41% of portfolio (down 32%)
* MSFT-33.26% of portfolio (up 6%)
* FB-13.83% of portfolio (down 18%)
* AAPL-13.63% of portfolio (up 16%)
* SGMO-6.87% of portfolio (down 26%)

As you can see, I've made some questionable decisions. My rationale for my losers was I believed MU was undervalued in its industry (before the China tariffs and other bad news) based on various factors, I thought that FB would bounce after the unpleasant earnings report in August, and I have followed SGMO for quite awhile and have confidence in what they do although they haven't had great news recently. I have been stubborn with not selling for a loss but I can't sit and hopelessly watch some of my holdings continue to fall. Hindsight is 20/20, had I known to buy more AAPL or MSFT I would've but I can't change that. I want to transition into some ETFs (SPY, QQQ, VTI, etc.) in order to limit my exposure to volatility and risk. As I mentioned, I am wondering whether to sell out of some of my positions or keep holding. I will  then change into less risky holdings. Thank you!

**tl;dr:** Made bad investment decisions with some stocks; have not been tracking my holdings as frequently as I should have lately. Need to know whether I should hold or sell for a hefty loss. Current holdings listed above.

Stocks traded choppily once again, going to the red in the morning before recovering throughout the rest of the day. Market participants continue to closely monitor developments from Washington regarding stimulus, a better-than-expected unemployment report, and third-quarter corporate earnings. 

The Nasdaq (QQQ) underperformed today, finishing the day even. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) finished 0.56% up and the Dow Jones (DIA) ended the day 0.62% up.

House Speaker Pelosi once again expressed optimism that an additional round of fiscal could be passed before the November 3 election, even as disagreements on key provisions remain in the White House. Pelosi said, Were just about there. The president wants a bull. Thats part of the opportunity we have. Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin were scheduled to speak on Thursday to discuss the deal, and the White Houses last public offer stood at around $1.88 trillion for a stimulus proposal, versus the $2.2 trillion plan put forth by House Democrats.

However, the proximity of the election and the lack of support for a bill in the GOP have market participants increasingly doubtful that a bill will be passed, fueling further volatility and uncertainty in the market. 

The Department of Labor released its weekly unemployment report, which showed that another 787,000 Americans filed for first-time unemployment claims, much better than the 870,000 expected by analysts. However, it is important to note an increasing number of individuals have exhausted state unemployment and have rolled into longer-term pandemic-related assistance programs. This shows the devastating effect the pandemic has had on the labor market. 

Today is the second and final presidential debate between President Trump and Joe Biden. The debate will take place in Nashville, Tennessee and will begin at 9 p.m. Eastern time and run for 90 minutes.
