Coming from an undergraduate background in social science, I am interested in data science because it is useful for such a wide array of problems, and I feel working in data science let's you focus on interesting subjects throughout your career. I am a Seattle native but came to DC to attend American University undergrad, where I majored in International Studies with a minor in Data Science. During undergrad, I focused on international relations research, but through a quantitative lens, writing papers on political bargaining in Somalia and modeling protest violence in the United States. After graduating during COVID, I worked for a small international development consulting firm, providing data science adjacent skills on a myriad of different development projects for USAID, Australia's DFAT, the World Bank, and others. I really enjoyed my time working in that field, but I wanted to learn more advanced ML methods, and so I am excited to be at Georgetown with the opportunity to dig into the concepts that interest me! After working on blended finance programs for several years

Research interests:
- Metalearning and ensembling for time series prediction
- Bet sizing and portfolio management
- Tying diverse datasets together

Outside school, I live in Arlington. Having lived around the DMV for the past 5 years off and on, I have found there are many exciting activities in the area. In particular, I enjoy getting outdoors however I can, such as hiking or just walking around different neighborhoods. I also love to cook, travel to other countries or just new US cities, develop video games, and try out as many coffee shops as possible! (Although the East Coast really hasn't approached Seattle's standards yet in my, totally biased, opinion.)
