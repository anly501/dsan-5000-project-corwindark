    "<h2> Introduction to Naive Bayes </h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "A naive bayes classifier assigns labels to observations using a process based on Bayes' theorem. The important element of the theorem is updating the probability of an event based on the known prior events. For instance, if all vehicles with 2 wheels are motorcycles, then we can update the probability that an unknown vehicle is a motorcycle given whether we know it has two wheels. In the case of a classification algorithm, the prosterior probabilities in question are the likelihoods that a given observation belongs to each class. Using the known prior events to update the probability of each class, the algorithm would take whichever class label had the highest likelihood and assign that to the data point in question. \n",
    "\n",
    "A naive Bayes classifier has several variants based on the types of features being used to predict class labels.\n",
    "- Gaussian: If the predictors are continuous, then we likely will not have exact probabilities for the given input point (as no other point may have the exact same value for all input features). As such, a different approach is required, where it is assumed that the continuous attributes are normally distributed. Then, for a given point that needs to be classified, we can express the probability of it belonging to a certain class as the likelihood that the point came from each class's distribution. This is relatively easy, as we can simply find the likelihood that the point was generated by each class distribution, and assign the most likely one as the label.\n",
    "- Multinomial: This method is preferred when the predictors are generated by a multinomial distribution, meaning they are discrete, with more than 2 levels. Labels would be assigned to new observations based on the conditional probability of observing the point's attributes given that it came from each class (which can be calculated again using Baye's theorem since the attributes are discirete).\n",
    "- Bernoulli Naive Bayes: The Bernoulli method is preferred when the predictors are binary, meaning they are discrete but only have two values they can take. This is calculated similar to the multinomial variant, but is even more straightforwards as there are only two classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective: With my Naive Bayes classifier, I hope to identify stocks in the top 10 by retail investor activity that have increases in retail investor activity on a given day. To do this I will convert a continuous variable (the daily change in retail investor activity) into two classes based on whether a given stock increased or decrease in activity day-over-day. The predictor variables I will use are measures of retail investor sentiment, namely the percent who were bullish and bearish in the previous week.\n",

    "<h2> Prep Data for Naive Bayes </h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "We are splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets to ensure we optimally fit the model and avoid over or under fitting. In particular, we can use the validation set to tune our model and improve its generalizability, and then use the test set to evaluate the performance of our model. I will do a 70-15-15 split between the train, evaluation, and test data, and this is done simply by randomly splitting the dataset."
