	abstract = {Accurate stock market prediction is of great interest to investors; however, stock markets are driven by volatile factors such as microblogs and news that make it hard to predict stock market index based on merely the historical data. The enormous stock market volatility emphasizes the need to effectively assess the role of external factors in stock prediction. Stock markets can be predicted using machine learning algorithms on information contained in social media and financial news, as this data can change investors’ behavior. In this paper, we use algorithms on social media and financial news data to discover the impact of this data on stock market prediction accuracy for ten subsequent days. For improving performance and quality of predictions, feature selection and spam tweets reduction are performed on the data sets. Moreover, we perform experiments to find such stock markets that are difficult to predict and those that are more influenced by social media and financial news. We compare results of different algorithms to find a consistent classifier. Finally, for achieving maximum prediction accuracy, deep learning is used and some classifiers are ensembled. Our experimental results show that highest prediction accuracies of 80.53\% and 75.16\% are achieved using social media and financial news, respectively. We also show that New York and Red Hat stock markets are hard to predict, New York and IBM stocks are more influenced by social media, while London and Microsoft stocks by financial news. Random forest classifier is found to be consistent and highest accuracy of 83.22\% is achieved by its ensemble.},

	abstract = {Deep learning has been widely applied in computer vision, natural language processing, and audio-visual recognition. The overwhelming success of deep learning as a data processing technique has sparked the interest of the research community. Given the proliferation of Fintech in recent years, the use of deep learning in finance and banking services has become prevalent. However, a detailed survey of the applications of deep learning in finance and banking is lacking in the existing literature. This study surveys and analyzes the literature on the application of deep learning models in the key finance and banking domains to provide a systematic evaluation of the model preprocessing, input data, and model evaluation. Finally, we discuss three aspects that could affect the outcomes of financial deep learning models. This study provides academics and practitioners with insight and direction on the state-of-the-art of the application of deep learning models in finance and banking.},

	abstract = {Whether stock prices are predictable has been the center of debate in academia. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model that combines a deep learning approach with a sentiment analysis model for stock price prediction. We employ a Convolutional Neural Network model for classifying the investors’ hidden sentiments, which are extracted from a major stock forum. We then propose a hybrid research model by applying the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network approach for analyzing the technical indicators from the stock market and the sentiment analysis results from the first step. Furthermore, this work has conducted real-life experiments from six key industries of three time intervals on the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) to validate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed model. The experiment results indicate that the proposed model has achieved better performance in classifying investor sentiments than the baseline classifiers, and this hybrid approach performs better in predicting stock prices compared to the single model and the models without sentiment analysis.},
